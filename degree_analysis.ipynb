       "['Optimization of vehicle speed in urban road using dynamic programming Recently, air pollution and global warming are considered as major social issues. Transportation is one of the contributors to air pollutant emissions by consuming fossil fuel. Energy-efficient driving, which reduces energy consumption by improving driving control, is needed to reduce emissions. In this paper, optimal speed profile for energy-efficient driving is generated by using dynamic programming that can achieve a global optimal solution. A conventional vehicle is selected as a target vehicle and modeled based on longitudinal dynamics. The vehicle travels in the urban road, taking into account different road conditions and constraints(e.g., traffic signal and speed limit). It is assumed that the vehicle has access to the traffic signal system data and geographical information by vehicle-to-information(V2I). The selected roads are discretized for optimization, and the road characteristics and traffic signals are determined according to each location. Meanwhile, the cost function includes the fuel consumption of the vehicle and trip time adjusted by weight factor. Optimization results showed that the vehicle consumes minimal fuel with fewer vehicle stops due to the traffic light. We analyzed the optimal speed profile generated in a specific case and the iterative optimization results set a suitable cost boundary by converging the trip time. Copyright © 2019 KSAE.',\n",
       " 'Analysis of improvement effect of rail design standard for high speed application of existing rail lines Among plans to increase the speed limit for existing railway lines, a new plan to straighten the tracks is expected to have the effect of shortening train travel time and increasing track capacity. However, such plans are not easy to execute due to excessive costs. A more economical and practical high-speed operation application plan is required that makes use of most existing railroad tracks without requirement for large investments. Railway lines are the biggest and basic factor that restrict train speed limits in railway track, and improvement methods must be planned to ensure that the characteristics and performance of operating trains accord with the rail properties. Specifically, factors to consider can be categorized into the following: flat curve radius, smooth curve length, curve placement, longitudinal slope, and vertical curve radius and arrangement. It is necessary to review each of the factors for high-speed applications on existing railway lines, such that existing tracks can produce higher maximum speed based on track specifications. © 2020 The Korean Society for Railway.

       " 'Effect of Cu, Cr, S doped Tio2 for transparent plastic bar reinforced concrete In this study, after firing and powdering Cu, Cr, and S with NP-400 TiO2, an NOx removal rate test was performed according to the ISO test method to analyze the photocatalytic reactivity in visible light. The distribution of the photocatalyst and visible light reactivity on the surface of the test specimen were confirmed through SEM (Scanning electron microscope), EDS (Energy dispersive spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction), UV-visible absorption spectrum and energy band gap tests. The flowability of UHPC (Ultra high performance concrete) slightly decreased due to the increase in the photocatalyst mixing rate, but both J-Ring and L-Box test results showed that there is no problem when concrete is placed. As a result of SEM and EDS tests, good microstructure and peak values were confirmed in the test specimens doped with Cu, and as a result of the XRD test, anatase and rutile peaks were confirmed in the Cu, Cr, and S specimens. In the UV-visible absorption spectrum analysis, it was confirmed that only the specimen doped with Cu maintains a high absorption power of 0.8 up to 700 nm, and the inherent band gaps are reduced to 2.9 eV, thereby increasing the possibility of reaction in visible light. Finally, as a result of the NOx removal test by the ISO test method, about 15.8% was removed for 5 h in the specimen doped with Cu, and the removal efficiency is estimated to be possible up to about 25% when applied with the TPBRC (transparent plastic bar reinforced concrete). © 2020 by the authors.

       "['Cation-Regulated Transformation for Continuous Two-Dimensional Tin Monosulfide The synthesis of a continuous and high-quality large-area layer is a key research area in the field of two-dimensional (2D) metal chalcogenides. To date, several techniques, including chemical vapor deposition and sulfurization/selenization, have been proposed for the synthesis of 2D metal chalcogenides. These techniques are based on the substitutional reaction of anions, that is, replacement of oxygen with chalcogen elements. This study uses a new approach based on cation-regulated transformation. An SnS2 layer, a parent material, is grown by atomic layer deposition, followed by reaction with bis(1-dimethlamino-2-methyl-2-propoxy)tin(II) at a temperature of 270 °C to form SnS. The reaction occurs predominantly along grain boundaries. The transformation self-terminates once the pregrown SnS2 is completely consumed. The devices utilizing the transformed layers, such as gas sensors and thin-film transistors, exhibit a p-type behavior, supporting full transformation of n-type SnS2 into p-type SnS. Consequently, complete transformation into a continuous and single-phase SnS layer is demonstrated by the cation-regulated transformation approach. This approach provides possibilities to expand approaches to the synthesis of more diverse 2D metal chalcogenides and the modulation of their properties.

       " 'Membraneless biofuel cells using new cathodic catalyst including hemin bonded with amine functionalized carbon nanotube and glucose oxidase sandwiched by poly(dimethyl-diallylammonium chloride) A new cathodic catalyst is developed for improving the performance of membraneless enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) by enhancing overall oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this catalyst, both hemin and glucose oxidase (GOx) are considered as enzymatic catalysts to facilitate H2O2 reduction reaction (HRR) and partial oxygen reduction reaction (PORR), respectively. Hemin is attached to amine group functionalized carbon nanotube (Amine-CNT) to form amide bond, and GOx is conjugated with two poly(dimethyl-diallylammonium chloride) (PDDA) layers to form sandwich-like structure. As a result, [Amine-CNT/Hemin]/PDDA/GOx/PDDA catalyst is completed. This catalyst plays a role in reducing the amount of GOx leached out and preserving the mass transfer of fuels, and finally, increasing the catalytic activity for cathodic reactions. According to electrochemical estimation, its onset potential reaches 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl and current density significantly increases to 323 μA cm−2. When the performance of membraneless EBC adopting this catalyst is measured, maximum power density is 24.1 ± 0.61 μW cm−2 and its activity preserves 82.1% after four weeks. This excellent result is because PORR and HRR are promoted by the rigid connection of GOx and hemin, which is mainly induced by the sandwich effect of GOx by PDDA layers. © 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry',\n",
       " 'Experimental and Modeling Study of Vapor Liquid Equilibrium for a Methyldiethanolamine-CO2-H2S-Water Quaternary System Using Activity Coefficient Models with Corrected Equilibrium Constants The solubilities of CO2 and H2S mixtures in methyldiethanolamine aqueous solutions were investigated in the wide temperature range from 313.15 (absorption range) to 403.15 K (stripping range) using the static method. The values of equilibrium constants for amine protonation (K1), activity coefficients (γi), and fugacity coefficients (φi) were regressed from the newly obtained experimental solubility data to correct nonideality. In order to obtain the equilibrium constants for amine protonation, modified Kent-Eisenberg model was applied. Then, two kinds of activity coefficient models, the Deshmukh-Mather model and the electrolyte nonrandom two-liquid model, were applied to minimize the gaps between experimental data and predicted values with newly obtained equilibrium constants. In this study, six thermodynamic models were presented by combining (1) equilibrium model and (2) activity coefficient models. Based on the best fitted solubility results, the mole fractions of all electrolytes, the pH in the liquid phase, and the heat of absorption for CO2 and H2S were evaluated. © 2019 American Chemical Society.']"

       "['Design and analysis of an effective graphics collaborative editing system With the rapid development of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) technology, graphical collaborative editing plays an increasingly important role in CSCW. The most important technique in graphics co-editing is the consistency of graphics co-editing, which mainly includes causality consistency, consistency of results, and consistency of intention. Most of the previous research was abstract and ineffective, lacking theoretical depth and scalability. However, because the algorithm proposed in this paper can solve the contradictions in the consistency of graphical collaborative editing, the research in this paper has particularity, and the results will be proven by the experiment described in the paper. In order to solve the consistency conflict problem of graphic collaborative editing, the common graphics collaborative editing algorithm (CGCE algorithm) is proposed. It is proposed not only to perfect and expand the definition of graphics collaborative editing but also to merge with HTML5 Canvas, WebSocket, jQuery, Node.js and other network programming languages and technologies. The graphic collaborative editing based on the design and implementation of this paper can effectively solve the consistency conflict problem of many users during the collaborative editing of graphics, which ensures that the graphics of each graphical collaborative editing interface is consistent and the collaborative work can achieve the desired effect. © 2019, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Comparison of electrical and interfacial characteristics between atomic-layer-deposited AlN and AlGaN on a GaN substrate The electrical and interfacial characteristics of AlN/GaN and AlGaN/GaN heterostructures prepared by thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) were investigated in this work. According to the parallel conductance method, the AlGaN/GaN sample showed two border traps with energies of ~ 0.38 and ~ 0.46\\xa0eV, which were not observed for the AlN/GaN sample. The AlN/GaN sample also showed a lower interface trap density and a lower reverse leakage current. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated that during the initial ALD deposition process, most of the Al and N atoms tended to combine with oxygen atoms as opposed to Ga atoms. As a result, AlGaN layer formation was delayed, resulting in the creation of a defective interfacial layer at the AlGaN/GaN interface. Thus, our results indicate that the initial ALD process should focus on removing the defective interfacial layer during AlGaN deposition for device optimization. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " \"High-resolution climate projections for a densely populated mediterranean region The present study projected future climate change for the densely populated Central North region of Egypt (CNE) for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and two futures (near future: 2020-2059, and far future: 2060-2099), estimated by a credible subset of five global climate models (GCMs). Different bias correction models have been applied to correct the bias in the five interpolated GCMs' outputs onto a high-resolution horizontal grid. The 0.05° CNE datasets of maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmx, and Tmn, respectively) and the 0.1° African Rainfall Climatology (ARC2) datasets represented the historical climate. The evaluation of bias correction methodologies revealed the better performance of linear and variance scaling for correcting the rainfall and temperature GCMs' outputs, respectively. They were used to transfer the correction factor to the projections. The five statistically bias-corrected climate projections presented the uncertainty range in the future change in the climate of CNE. The rainfall is expected to increase in the near future but drastically decrease in the far future. The Tmx and Tmn are projected to increase in both future periods reaching nearly a maximum of 5.50 and 8.50 °C for Tmx and Tmn, respectively. These findings highlighted the severe consequence of climate change on the socio-economic activities in the CNE aiming for better sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.\"]"
