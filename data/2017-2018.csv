However, the implementation of these sensors in an underwater environment is challenging because of signal uncertainties and strong signal attenuation. In this paper, we propose an underwater localization scheme with a sensor fusion of inertial navigation system (INS) and received signal strength of electromagnetic (EM) waves sensors. In the proposed sensor-fusion-based localization scheme, the UUV predicts its location by using INS based on dead-reckoning and corrects the predicted position by Kalman filter using EM waves sensor information when the UUV receives the signals of EM waves sensors in underwater wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme enables localization with high accuracy and high sampling rate during a long-term task. The results of an experiment performed in a basin environment shows the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The scheme achieved reliable localization accuracy by comparing the pre-measured ground-truth position and long-term navigation. These results show the feasibility of exploiting EM waves attenuation as Earth-fixed reference sensors. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Air navigation; Electromagnetic waves; Inertial navigation systems; Intelligent robots; Navigation; Underwater acoustics; Wireless sensor networks; High sampling rates; Inertial navigation systems (INS); Localization accuracy; Localization schemes; Received signal strength; Underwater environments; Underwater localization; Underwater wireless sensor networks; Unmanned underwater vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062975866

The mechanisms for four functions - jumping, steering, self-righting and take-off angle adjustment - are designed using only two motors to maximize the jumping performance. Jumping uses the modified active triggering mechanism with one motor. Steering shares this motor and uses the wheel touching the ground. The take-off angle is adjusted by changing the angle between the body and the foot using another motor. Self-righting is possible by utilizing combinations of the movements that occur in the energy storing and angle adjustment processes. With these four functions, the robot is capable of jumping in all directions and can jump anywhere in between the maximum height and maximum distance. It can also jump multiple times by self-righting. The robot, with a mass of 64.4 g, jumps up to 113 cm in vertical height, and 170 cm in horizontal distance. This robot can be deployed to explore various environments. Moreover, the design method to implement more functions than the number of motors can be applied to design other small-scale robots. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Machine design; Angle adjustments; Design method; Maximum distance; Self-righting; Small scale; Take-off angle; Triggering mechanism; Two-motor; Intelligent robots",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062966682

These pillars, however, tend to cluster upon water evaporation due to the capillary force and lowered modulus of the pillars. Here, spontaneous recovery of clustered slanted hydrogel pillars to their original shape is presented by exploiting the modulus change of hydrogel materials during water evaporation. The clustering and recovery of the slanted hydrogel micropillars are monitored in situ by optical microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy. To elucidate sequential clustering and recovery mechanism, the adhesion force between the pillars and the restoring force is compared. Finally, the dynamic change of optical transparency is exploited as the result of switching between clustering and recovery of the slanted micropillars for display.

A treated cafeteria wastewater which has Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of 33,500 mg•L -1 was used as the substrate and compared with commercial sugar as the control sample. During the process, the substrate was changed partially after 5 days and resulted power density of 73.7?4.57 mW•m -2 . The COD of cafeteria wastewater removed by 30.1% from its initial concentration and then decreased by 40.8% after substrate partially replaced. Increasing optical density of microalgae in the cathode side from 0.6 to 1.37 could improve the oxygen reduction reaction which useful for electricity production.

A cross-sectional study was carried out among students who took part in the co-curricular program. Co-curricular program includes activities that take place outside of the regular lectures or tutorials in the University. Students recruited through purposive sampling were informed that their participation was entirely voluntarily. Those interested completed the self-administered questionnaire, which consisted of the decisional balance, processes of change, self-efficacy, stages of change scales, and Godin leisure-time exercise questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Mplus version 8 for descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling analysis for inferential statistics. A total of 562 students participated in the study. The majority of the students was female (79.0%) and Malay (73.3%) and average of exercise sessions per week was 2.62, with a mean of 43.37 min per exercise session. The final structural model fit the data well based on several fit indices (SRMR = 0.046, RMSEA (CI: 90%) = 0.061 (0.045, 0.078), RMSEA p = 0.130). The model showed that stages of change significantly affected self-efficacy (p < 0.001), pros (benefits of exercise; p < 0.001), cons (barriers to exercise; p = 0.022), and processes of change (p < 0.001). The model also showed significant inter-relationships among the TTM constructs and supported seven hypotheses. Among all the variables examined, only processes of change significantly affected PA (p < 0.001). However, stages of change (p < 0.001) and pros (p = < 0.001) had significant indirect effects on PA via processes of change. The findings support that individuals' stages of change affect their self-efficacy level, or the ability to make positive and negative decisions and perform behavior accordingly. The study confirms that making correct decisions and taking action accordingly can increase PA levels. © 2018 Liu, Kueh, Arifin, Kim and Kuan.","Decisional balance; Physical activity; Processes of change; Self-efficacy; Structural equation modeling; Transtheoretical model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058664486

In this study, a role of diamide linkage chain length of DCAs as a tyrosinase inhibitor was investigated on tyrosinase inhibitory activity, antioxidative activity, hydrophobicity and anti-melanogenesis as well as structural characteristics and dipole moments based on density functional theory. DCAs with different diamide-link chain lengths (n = 2, 3, and 4) and various functional groups (m-coumaroyl, p-coumaroyl, isoferuloyl and feruloyl groups) were synthesized. DCAs with a diamide-link chain length of three indicated high inhibitory effect of melanin production on α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) stimulated B16F1 cells. Approach of p-hydroxyl group of DCAs to active site of tyrosinase, an important melanogenic enzyme, is interfered by addition of m-methoxy group. In structural modeling based on density functional theory, DCAs with a diamide-link chain length of three showed folded shapes, and they had lower dipole moment than with a diamide-link chain length of two or four. Thus, for the enhancement of the depigmenting activities of dimeric compounds, the diamide-link chain length is important.

A systematic way to define a reference state for the given torque reference is provided. The reference state is determined according to three different operational modes to yield the highest possible efficiency. First, at low speeds, the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) is achieved considering ohmic loss minimization. Second, the flux reference is limited by increasing the slip frequency with increase in the reference torque. Third, MTPA in field-weakening region is adopted. In proposed MPC, a cost index is defined using the derived reference state and the optimal control input is determined considering the input constraints. This control input is obtained without use of any numerical algorithm at each time step. The stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is performed. The proposed control is implemented and validated by simulation and experimental studies at steady and transient states.

The annual economic values of six training centers were estimated using the data from a total of 1658 firefighters who responded to the CE survey questionnaire, with a 1% statistical significance level. The economic value of the FTA amounts to KRW 10.04 billion (USD 8.80 million) annually. Given the 30-year operating period, the present value is KRW 129.86 billion, which can be seen as the economic benefit of building the FTA.

Therefore, the reliability of motor drive can be improved by increasing the lifetime of the most stressed device.

An optimized switching is implemented on the two interleaved boost circuits resulting in a ripple-free grid current without a ripple cancellation network; hence small filter inductors are used. A simple and reliable closed-loop control system is easily implemented, since the phase-shift angle is the only independent variable. Moreover, current imbalance is avoided in the presented topology despite the CCM operation without current control loop in each phase.

Furthermore, IC technology paradigms have been shifted to one-chip integration, 3D integration, and multi-function integration. However, since the scaling-down of IC devices has been reached to their physical limitations, several innovative packaging technologies such as 3D packaging, embedded packaging, and fan-out wafer level packaging (FOWLP) are actively studied for high I/O devices. In this study polysilsesquioxane (PSSQ) dielectric materials were investigated for the use of multi-structured redistribution layers in FOWLP applications. Organic-inorganic hybrid dielectric is expected to improve mechanical reliability and thermal stability. In addition, PSSQ has an excellent advantage of simultaneous curing and patterning through UV exposure. A PSSQ solution was spin-coated on 6-inch Si wafer followed by pre-baking and UV exposure. Then the pattern capability of PSSQ dielectric was evaluated by a scanning electron microscope, and the good pattern capability of 2?m lines was obtained. The dielectric constant of cured PSSQ was ranged from 2.0 to 2.4, and the dielectric loss was ranged from 0.0001 to 0.005.

Among three key processes in 3D packaging a low temperature Cu-to-Cu wafer bonding is the subject of interest in this study. To accommodate high conductivity, non-formation of intermetallic compound, fine pitch connectivity, high pin count, and low cost, Cu-to-Cu wafer bonding is becoming increasingly important in advanced IC device packaging manufacturing. However, for high bonding quality, Cu-to-Cu wafer bonding requires high temperature process above 400oC, which is not allowed in IC device packaging manufacturing. In this study the effect of Ar-N2 plasma treatment on Cu surface was investigated for low temperature Cu-to-Cu wafer bonding applications. Ar gas is used in a plasma ignition and the activation of Cu surface by ion bombardments, and the purpose of N2 gas was to passivate Cu surface from contaminations such as -O or -OH. The Cu/Ti/SiO2/Si specimens were fabricated on 8-inch Si wafers. Then various Ar-N2 plasma treatments were performed on Cu wafer surface. After the Ar-N2 plasma treatments, electrical and structural properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscope, and 4-point probe measurements.

However, as size of Cu pillar bump and pitch decreasing, Cu pillar bump technology face some problems such as interconnect shorting, higher low-k stress when the conventional mass reflow process is used. To solve this problem, several new bonding processes has been developed such as the thermal compression bonding (TCB) and laser assisted bonding, New bonding processes has been developed to meet the requirements of fine pitch and higher reliability of Cu pillar bump technology. During TCB process or laser assisted bonding process, the substrate has a lower temperature than the chip, which reduces the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch-induced stresses and package warpage. In this study, the absorptivity, reflectivity and transmittivity of Si chips were measured by using spectrometer and halogen lamp. The obtained absorptivity was applied to numerical analysis to optimize laser assisted bonding conditions. We performed laser reflow and laser thermal compression bonding warpage simulation using finite element analysis.

However, most research on reinforced soil retaining walls focus on two-dimensional linear parts. The behaviour of curved parts in reinforced soil retaining wall is questionable, and collapse of that also occurs frequently. Therefore, in this study, reinforced soil retaining walls were modelled by stacking blocks of 0.4 × 0.5 × 0.4 m (length × width × height), and the retaining walls were divided into four cases (heights of 3.2, 5.2, 7.2, 9.2 m). The failure behavior of the straight parts and the curved parts were compared, depending on the height. Based on the height of the reinforced soil retaining wall, the failure behaviours of the curved parts and straight parts of the reinforced soil retaining wall were predicted through 3D numerical analysis. This study aims to raise the necessity of research on the curved parts. © 2018, The Author(s).","3D numerical; Curved parts; Failure behaviour; Height; Reinforced soil retaining wall; Straight parts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062389861

Lysozyme in tears plays a primary role in protecting eye from harmful environments; if lysozyme is degraded or inhibited, eyes are likely to be more vulnerable to bacterial infection. In this study, lysozyme activity was evaluated according to varying concentrations of heavy metals, copper, zinc, cobalt and manganese and light metal, calcium that are frequently found in airborne particulate matters and was assayed using a dye-quenching lysozyme substrate, Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Less fluorescence intensity was observed with increasing amounts of copper, zinc, manganese and cobalt but not with calcium suggesting that these metals have some affinity with lysozyme and inhibit lysozyme activity. When albumin, the second most common protein in tears, was added on the reaction of lysozyme and metals, lysozyme activity was partially restored. This finding suggests that the albumin might protect damage caused by metals on lysozyme. To identify whether the decrease in enzymatic activity was related to structural changes of lysozyme, SDS-PAGE was conducted and only with copper did lysozyme show marked smearing bands on the SDS-gel, meaning that copper degraded lysozyme consistent with the sharpest activity decrease. © The Korean Society for Applied Biological Chemistry 2018.","Albumin; Heavy Metals; Lysozyme activity",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060857707

However, since there are limitations in applying the concept of record management to design archive methodology, the concept research should be conducted. Although this study originates from archives, the study focuses on the open concept of 'archiving' because archives are recognized as hardware, such as archives and museums. Methods In order to trace the current meaning of design archiving, this research generalized the type of archive with an inductive approach, but proceeded to understand the motives and perceptions of social actors and to organize the concepts. I set up two axes of current status and awareness research, and I analyzed the recent interviews of experts related to archives, archive issues, and phenomenon on archives. Results In general, most activities in design archiving are based on the concept of archival management, which has been widely used. It has been confirmed that contemporary design archiving needs to be defined unlike a typical archival concept.

However, indiscreet provision and application of design themes for virtual keyboards can degrade the performance of text input. In this study, we investigated how the contrast design between the background color and the button color of the virtual keyboard affects the user's touch behavior and performance during text input. Methods For the purpose, we have developed an experimental app that can perform text input with one of five different contrast designs (WW, WG, GB, GG, and NB) in virtual keyboard. The app automatically recorded the usability and touch point data during text input. Participants performed the task of inputting given sentences quickly without any typos by using five virtual keyboards in random order. Results Experimental results showed that the contrast between the background and the buttons of the virtual keyboard influenced the speed and satisfaction of the text input. Furthermore, according to the contrast design, the size of the Y-axis shift or distribution of the touch point has also changed. Collectively, the WW keyboard (white button on a light gray background), which is the most common design and has the same contrast as iPhone's default keyboard, was the best in typing speed and subjective satisfaction. On the other hand, the design that is difficult to distinguish between background and buttons (NB keyboard, no contrast) has had a very negative impact on typing speed and satisfaction. Conclusions The contrast between the background and buttons of a virtual keyboard is not only a matter of aesthetic design but can also affect touch behavior and text input usability. Smartphone and application makers have to make a careful decision about the default contrast of virtual keyboards. © 2018, Korean Society of Design Science.연구배경 스마트폰 가상키보드는 디자인을 사용자가 원하는 대로 변경할 수 있도록 다양한 테마들을 제공한 다. 하지만 무분별한 가상키보드 디자인 테마의 제공과 적용은 문자입력 수행도를 저하시킬 수도 있다. 이에 본 연구에서는 스마트폰 가상키보드의 디자인 요소 중 배경색과 버튼색 간의 명암대비가 문자입력 시의 터치 행태 와 수행도에 어떠한 영향을 미치는지 실험을 통해 조사하였다. 연구방법 본 연구에서는 명암대비 디자인만 다른 다섯 유형 (WW, WG, GB, GG, NB)의 가상키보드로 문자 입력을 수행하고, 사용성 및 터치타점 데이터를 자동으로 기록해주는 실험 앱을 개발하였다. 실험참여자들은 임 의의 순서로 다섯 가상키보드를 활용하여 주어진 문장을 오타 없이 가능한 빠르게 입력하는 태스크를 수행하였 다. 연구결과 실험 결과, 가상키보드의 배경과 버튼 간 명암대비는 문자입력의 속도와 만족도에 영향을 미쳤다. 더욱이 명암대비에 따라 터치 타점의 Y축 치우침이나 타점 분포의 크기도 달라졌다. 종합적으로 가장 일반적인 디자인이며 아이폰의 기본 키보드와 동일한 명암대비를 가진 WW키보드 (연한 회색 배경에 흰색 버튼)가 입력 속도, 사용 만족도, 디자인 순위에서 가장 좋았다. 반면, 배경과 버튼 간 구분이 어려운 디자인 (NB키보드, 대비 없음)은 입력속도와 만족도에 매우 부정적인 영향을 주었다. 결론 가상키보드의 배경과 버튼 간의 명암대비는 심미적 디자인의 문제일 뿐 아니라 터치행태와 문자입 력 사용성에도 영향을 줄 수 있다. 스마트폰 제조사나 어플 제작자들은 가상키보드의 디폴트 대비를 신중하게 결 정해야 한다.","Contrast design; Text input; Touch pattern; Virtual keyboard; 가상키보드; 명암 대비; 문자 입력; 터치 패턴",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059400474

The effect of storage temperature on detachment and denaturation of glucose oxidase (GOx) biocatalyst has been proved. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) as entrapping polymer to attract more GOx to form a durable and layered CNT/PEI/GOx structure is used for long-term storage to minimize GOx detachment from the structure and minimize the possibility of enzyme and protein denaturation. After 120 days, the glucose response of the CNT/PEI/GOx biosensor stored under 4°C is preserved up to 66.7% of its initial value, while under a 25 °C storage the response is maintained up to 41.7%. The enzyme coverage activity of CNT/PEI/GOx stored at 4 °C and 25 °C has decreased by 31.1% and 51.4%, respectively. Denaturation and detachment of GOx are the common causes of thermal degradation in biosensors under improper storage temperatures, but the presence of PEI in the structure can slow-down these phenomena. Moreover, the electrons transfer constant of CNT/PEI/GOx biocatalyst stored at 4 °C and 25 °C were 7.5 ± 0.5 s-1 and 6.6 ± 0.3 s-1, respectively, indicating that also electrons mobility is damaged by detachment and denaturation of enzyme protein and the detection of glucose from the glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) is compromised. © 2018 by the authors.","Carbon nanotube; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensor; Polyethylenimine; Thermal degradation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059246705

The control of the driving of a common rail diesel injector is achieved by controlling the current waveform supplied to the injector. In order to control various current waveforms flowing in the common rail injector, 80 V of power supplied to the injector was switched using a negative-positive-negative (NPN) 2N3055 transistor. The transistor-transistor logic (TTL) switching signal supplied to the base terminal of the NPN 2N3055 transistor was generated from the capture compare PWM (CCP) terminal of a microcontroller. The PWM signal generated from the CCP pin creates five patterns of waveforms by combining the peak-and-hold conditions. In the first part of the 1ms injection period, the duty ratio is 100 %, while the remaining part has a waveform with a greatly reduced duty ratio. The duty ratio used in this study was 10 % or 30 %. The time-resolved pressure wave caused by fuel injection in the Bosch method was repeatedly measured. For an uncertainty analysis, 39 repetitive measurements were taken per fuel injection condition. The rail pressures used in this study were 80, 110 and 140 MPa. With five pick-and-hold current waves supplied to the injector under a rail pressure condition, the time-resolved pressure waves caused by the fuel injection tended to be almost equal during the peak duration, whereas those during the hold duration differed. The duration of the pressure wave caused by the fuel injection is prolonged at a high hold current. When the common rail pressure is high, the slope of the pressure wave in the pick interval is steeper. A parameter that can effectively evaluate the optimal current control pattern for lower power consumption and thermal dissipation of the injector solenoid is also presented. © 2018, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bosch method; Current profile; Duty ratio; Injected fuel pressure wave; Peak and hold; Pulse width modulation (PWM)","Fuel injection; Fuels; Pulse width modulation; Transistors; Voltage control; Bosch method; Current profile; Duty ratios; Injected fuel; Peak and hold; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058930601

Accordingly, appropriate treatments are in demand. Pesticide detection methods have been researched extensively, aimed at making the detection convenient, fast, cost-effective, and easy to use. Among the various detecting strategies, paper-based assay is potent for real-time pesticide sensing due to its unique advantages including disposability, light weight, and low cost. In this study, a paper-based sensor for chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide, has been developed by layering three sheets of patterned plates. In colorimetric quantification of pesticides, the blue color produced by the interaction between acetylcholinesterase and indoxyl acetate is inhibited by the pesticide molecules present in the sample solutions. With the optimized paper-based sensor, the pesticide is sensitively detected (limit of detection=8.60 ppm) within 5 min. Furthermore, the shelf life of the device is enhanced to 14 days after from the fabrication, by treating trehalose solution onto the deposited reagents.

The range between the lower and upper explosion limits of leaking LPG for welding and cutting work was examined using Le Chatelier's formula; the behavior of LPG concentration change, which included dispersion and concentration change, was analyzed using the fire dynamic simulator (FDS). We concluded that the primary cause of the accident was combustible LPG that leaked from a welding and cutting torch and formed a explosion range between the lower and upper limits. When the LPG contacted the flame of the welding and cutting torch, LPG explosion occurred. The LPG explosion power calculation was verified by the blast effect computation program developed by the Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB).

Atomic layer deposition (ALD), can deposit thin films through atomic layering producing uniform and conformal high-k thin films with precise thickness control. While relatively low crystallinity of film quality due to low deposition temperatures of ALD can develop practical issues, they can be overcome by employing additional processes such as thermal annealing, plasma treatment, and seed layering. ALD, STO and BTO thin films treated with these additional processes demonstrate more improved crystallinity and electrical properties.

The redox potential of methylene blue was shifted to negative direction as pH increased. The full-cell performance was evaluated by using methylene blue as the negative active material and vanadium as the positive active material with acid supporting electrolytes. The cell voltage of methylene blue/V4+ is very low (0.45 V). In addition, the maximum solubility of methylene blue in water is only 0.12 M. Therefore, the cell test was performed with very low concentration (0.0015 M methylene blue, 0.15 M V4+) at first time. Cut-off voltage range was 0 to 0.8 V and 1 mA·cm-2 current density was adopted during cycling. As a result, current efficiency (CE) was 99.67%, voltage efficiency (VE), 88.83% and energy efficiency (EE) was 85.87% and discharge capacity was (0.0500 Ah·L-1) at 4 cycle. In addition, the cell test was performed with increased concentration (0.1 M methylene blue, 0.15 M V4+) with 10 mA·cm-2 current density, leading to higher discharge capacity (3.8122 Ah·L-1) with similar efficiency (CE=99%, VE=85%, EE=85% at 4 cycle). © 2018 Wideochirurgia I Inne Techniki Maloinwazyjne.

LEDs have been used for medical treatments but red-colored visible LEDs have been mainly used therein before the multi-color LED chip-on-board technologies become widely available. UV-LEDs now have wider range of applications in sterilization, sensing, and detection. This paper overviews currently available fabrication techniques and biomedical applications of UV-LEDs.

These sensors have limitations when the accumulated fine particles saturate the measurement range. In this study, we have studied how to effectively remove the accumulated particles after detection, rather than measuring the sensing performance. In general, MEMS sensors are used to detect fine particles in a high frequency region for higher resolution. However, in this work, we fabricated an oscillating platform that could be driven at a relatively low frequency region (< MHz), which the high sensing resonance. As an example of fine particles, fine dust having a diameter of 1 to 10 mm was used. The fabricated lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric oscillating platform had a resonant frequency of 424.1 kHz, with a sensitivity of 934.2 nm/V at the resonance point. This oscillating platform was able to effectively provide sufficient acceleration to remove the dust from the surface when subjected to resonance. We have predicted the minimum required voltage to remove the particles based on van der Waals force theory, and the measured sensitivity (nm/V) of the oscillator. These values agreed to the experimentally measured voltages when the dust particles started to detach from the surface.

In outdoor AR systems, the real outdoor light source (i.e., the sun) illuminates real objects, while a virtual light source illuminates the augmented virtual objects. These two light sources result in color differentials, with the real object and virtual object being visualized as a mixture of the colors induced by the two light sources. As such, there is a visible difference in color between the real object and the virtual object. Consequently, this visible color difference will vitiate the sense of immersion felt by the AR user. Thus, to overcome this problem, we have defined each RGB color channel value by analyzing the color generated by the outdoor light source and applied the defined values to the virtual light source to reduce the visibility of the color differential between the two light sources, thereby reducing the visualized incompatibility between the virtual object and the real background. In addition, using virtual objects to express weather events, in combination with the color estimation method, we were able to demonstrate that the proposed method can adequately adapt to and manage the weather changes that affect outdoor AR. The proposed method has the potential to improve the visual coincidence between the real outdoor background and virtual objects. © 2018, The Author(s).","Augmented reality; Color temperature; Outdoor lighting; Real weather","Augmented reality; Colorimetry; Light sources; Color difference; Color estimation; Color temperatures; Natural lighting; Outdoor augmented reality; Virtual objects; Weather change; Weather events; Color",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056105462

The Pathfinder software was employed for evacuation simulation analysis, where the maximum acceptable evacuation time in the worst case was set to 6 min following engineering considerations of station characteristics and according to the domestic railway guide. We found that a single delay increased the evacuation time by 119%, whereas two delays reached a 133% increase.

For synthesizing the catalyst, CNT is linked to the phosphate group of the PHOS, forming phosphate functionalized carbon nanotube (POH-CNT). Its catalytic activity is then compared with those of pure CNT and carboxylic acid functionalized CNT (CA-CNT) catalysts. Regarding the redox reactivity of vanadium ions, POH-CNT exhibits superior catalytic activity and reaction reversibility for VO2+/VO2+ reaction to CNT and CA-CNT because of (i) the chelation ability of phosphate group, (ii) its low electron delocalization capability and (iii) its high acid dissociation constant. By the role as chelating agent of phosphate group, the density of active sites for reaction of VO2+ and VO2+ ions in POH-CNT increase. Also, the low electron delocalization and high acid dissociation constant induce effective adsorption and desorption of VO2+ and VO2+ ions. Such effects facilitate the VO2+/VO2+ reaction. In contrast, regarding V2+/V3+ reaction, POH-CNT shows equivalent reactivity to CA-CNT because phosphate and carboxyl groups form similar active sites for the V2+/V3+ reaction. The above results are supported by calculating kinetic parameters, such as charge transfer resistance and diffusion coefficient, while chemical bonding of the catalysts is examined by XPS. Finally, as the POH-CNT is used as catalyst for positive electrode prompting the VO2+/VO2+ reaction, performance of VRFB single cell is improved. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Acid dissociation constant; Chelation ability; Electron delocalization; Phosphorylethanolamine; Vanadium redox flow battery","Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Chelation; Chemical bonds; Dissociation; Flow batteries; Ions; Redox reactions; Vanadium; Vanadium dioxide; Yarn; Acid dissociation constants; Adsorption and desorptions; Charge transfer resistance; Electron delocalization; Functionalized carbon nanotubes; Phosphorylethanolamine; Positive electrodes; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054919895

Due to the large volume of data generated from IoT devices, limited bandwidth, high latency, and realtime analysis requirements, the conventional centralized network architecture cannot meet users requirements. Intensive real-time data analysis is one of the major challenges in current state-ofthe- art centralized architectures due to the ubiquitous deployment of different types of sensors. To address the current challenges and adhere to the principles of architectural design, we are proposing a SoftEdgeNet model, which is a novel SDN-based distributed layered network architecture with a blockchain technique for a sustainable edge computing network. At the fog layer, we introduce an SDN-based secure fog node architecture to mitigate security attacks and provide real-time analytics services. We are also proposing a flow rule partition, and allocation algorithm at the edge of the network. The evaluation result shows our proposed model allows for a significant improvement of the interactions in real time data transmission. In terms of the ability to mitigate flooding attacks, the bandwidth is maintained above 9 Mb/s until the attack rates exceed 2000 PPS in the hardware environment and the bandwidth remained almost unchanged in the software environment. In the case of scalability of the proposed model, our proposed algorithm has performed better and proceeded linearly with the increase in traffic volume. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Computer architecture; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Network layers; Real time systems; Allocation algorithm; Centralized architecture; Computational model; Distributed network architectures; Hardware environment; Real time data analysis; Real time data transmission; Software environments; Network architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054263485

The bilayer was fabricated by tethering 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphothioethanol on a gold surface to form a monolayer and then using liposomes to adsorb an upper layer on the tethered monolayer. The liposomes were prepared with a desired ratio (mol/mol) of trehalose to lipid, before the adsorption was performed. The formation of the adsorbed layer was monitored with SPR, and the SPR responses were converted to the surface density of the layer. In addition, the CV measurement was conducted to acquire the current–potential responses to evaluate the charge permeability of the layer. The surface density was gradually increased with the trehalose ratio up to 0.5, while the charge permeability was decreased. From these changes, the trehalose appears to be related to the curvature generation induced by the trehalose, which is consistent with the previous simulation results. In the identical measurements at glucose, little change in the properties was observed with even up to 2:1 ratio of glucose:lipid. These results seem attributed to the osmotic and volumetric effect on the headgroup packing disruption.

Here, we report high-lattice distortion at edges of Pt nanocrystals during heterogeneous catalytic methane oxidation based on in situ 3D Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. We directly observe contraction at edges owing to adsorption of oxygen. This strain increases during methane oxidation and it returns to the original state after completing the reaction process.

Humans, too, can be considered an integral part of the IoT ecosystem. The growing human-centricity of IoT applications raises the need greater dynamicity, heterogeneity, and scalability in future IoT systems. Recently, the IoT and cloud computing have both evolved as emerging technologies and have already become part of our daily life. The complementary features of the IoT and cloud are forming a new IT paradigm to meet current and future requirements. Due to the increased demand for and volume of IoT data, it has become a critical challenge to transfer data from the edge of the network to computing data centers due to the limitations of network bandwidth and higher latency delay. The emergence of the new paradigm of computing in the cloud computing architecture has made it necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of cloud computing, such as location awareness, scalability, energy efficiency, mobility, bandwidth bottlenecks, and latency delay. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient hybrid cloud architecture framework coupled with Li-Fi communication for a human-centric IoT network. It also introduces the architecture of the local cloud to reduce the latency delay and bandwidth cost and to improve efficiency, security, reliability and availability.

The CTI system creates reputation information for network resources such as IP, URL, and file hash-based on security data collected from security information and event management (SIEM) systems. This information can be applied extensively in industrial infrastructures to provide an effective response process for cyber attacks. This information can also be applied to the security systems of internal IT and OT infrastructures such as Internet objects (IoT) and Surveillance Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks. However, because the performance of infrastructure security using CTI depends on the accuracy of the data on which the system is based, careful consideration of the accuracy of the data is required. In this paper, we propose a new model that can analyze the reliability and validity of data by using comparative analysis between CTI data and present a criterion for evaluating the reliability of feed providing CTI data.

Among various EC schemes, the combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) is widely used for FMC because it achieves high compression efficiency with low computational complexity. However, there is room for improvement in the conventional DWT and SPIHT algorithm because it compresses all blocks with the same compression ratio without taking into account the correlation between DWT coefficients and the SPIHT algorithm. This study proposes a novel one-dimensional (1-D) DWT and SPIHT algorithm, which enhances the quality of the compressed video by internally applying an adaptive compression ratio for the SPIHT algorithm based on DWT coefficients while keeping the same bit-stream size. The block complexity is predicted from the distribution of DWT coefficients. Then, simple blocks are aggressively compressed with a low compression ratio, while the complex blocks are compressed with a high ratio. Furthermore, to achieve the best video quality, each compression ratio is decided by an optimization technique based on mathematical formulation. Precisely, the logarithm of mean squared error by the SPIHT algorithm is assumed to be linearly correlated with the logarithm of processed DWT coefficients. Experimental results are provided that support the aforementioned model. Compared to the conventional 1-D DWT and SPIHT algorithm, the proposed scheme remarkably improves the video quality by an average of 2.23 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio when the target compression ratio for the SPIHT algorithm is 5/16. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive compression ratio; discrete wavelet transform; embedded compression; frame memory compression; optimization; set partitioning in hierarchical trees; video compression","Bandwidth compression; Computational efficiency; Discrete wavelet transforms; Forestry; Mean square error; One dimensional; Optimization; Signal reconstruction; Video signal processing; Adaptive compression; Embedded compression; Frame memory; Low computational complexity; Mathematical formulation; Mobile multimedia device; Optimization techniques; Set partitioning in hierarchical tree; Image compression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046371865

In this paper, a novel real-time color image segmentation method is proposed, which is based on color similarity in RGB color space. According to the color and luminance information in RGB color space, the dominant color is determined at first, and then color similarity can be calculated with the proposed calculation method of color component, which creates a color-class map. Next, the information of the corresponding color-class map is utilized to classify the pixels. Due to the characteristic that thermal inks feature color values that change in real time as the temperature changes, the segmentation results of thermal ink can be used as a real-time color sensor.

Recently, adopting sink mobility has been considered as a good strategy to overcome the hot spot problem. Mobile sink(s) physically move within the network and communicate with selected nodes, such as cluster heads (CHs), to perform direct data collection through short-range communications that requires no routing. Finding an optimal mobility trajectory for the mobile sink is critical in order to achieve energy efficiency. Taking hints from nature, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has been seen as a good solution to finding an optimal traversal path. Whereas the traditional ACO algorithm will guide ants to take a small step to the next node using current information, over time they will deviate from the target. Likewise, a mobile sink may communicate with selected node for a relatively long time making the traditional ACO algorithm delays not suitable for high real-time WSNs applications. In this paper, we propose an improved ACO algorithm approach for WSNs that use mobile sinks by considering CH distances. In this research, the network is divided into several clusters and each cluster has one CH. While the distance between CHs is considered under the traditional ACO algorithm, the mobile sink node finds an optimal mobility trajectory to communicate with CHs under our improved ACO algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve wireless sensor network performance compared to other routing algorithms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ant colony optimization; Clustering; Energy efficiency; Mobile sink; Wireless sensor networks","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Wireless sensor networks; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Clustering; Improved ant colony optimization; Mobile sinks; Optimal mobility trajectory; Overall networks; Short-range communication; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026510379

Thus, South Korea electricity authorities demand information about the value of improved power supply reliability for the manufacturing sector to implement them in planning electricity supply. This article aims to measure the value using a specific case of South Korean manufacturing firms. The choice experiment (CE) approach is adopted for this purpose. A nationwide CE survey of 1148 manufacturing firms was undertaken. The firms revealed statistically significant willingness to pay for a decrease in the duration of interruption, avoiding interruption during daytime (9 a.m. to 6 p.m.) rather than off-daytime (6 p.m. to 9 a.m.), and preventing interruption during weekdays rather than weekend. For example, they accepted a 0.02% increase in the electricity bill for reducing one minute of interruption during electricity outage, a 2.98% increase in the electricity bill to avoid interruption during the daytime rather than off-daytime, and a 1.60% increase in electricity bill for preventing interruption during weekdays rather than weekends. However, they put no importance on the season of interruption. These results can be useful for policy-making and decision-making regarding improving electricity supply reliability. © 2018 by the authors.","Choice experiment; Electricity; Manufacturing industry; Power supply reliability; Willingness to pay","decision making; electricity; electricity supply; firm size; manufacturing; survey method; willingness to pay; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057841065

Preservatives are often used to prevent their contamination upon use. There has been a great demand for natural preservatives due to recent reports on the side effects of parabens. Therefore, we evaluated the antimicrobial activities of Lonicera japonica and Magnolia obovata extracts and determined their potential as natural preservatives. We found that the 50% ethanol extract from L. japonica had antibacterial activity only against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, while the ethyl acetate fraction showed antimicrobial activity against all six microbial strains tested. On the other hand, the 70% ethanol extract and the ethyl acetate fraction from M. obovata showed antimicrobial activity against all six strains. A synergistic effect against S. aureus, B. subtilis, and C. albicans was confirmed when two ethyl acetate fractions having antimicrobial activity against all six strains were used in combination. Synergistic activity against B. subtilis was also confirmed through kill-time analysis. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to identify the components of each extract. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and the results of a disc diffusion assay, we confirmed that caffeic acid and luteolin influenced the antimicrobial activity of L. japonica and that the antimicrobial activity of M. obovata was influenced by the interaction of magnolol and honokiol with other components. Therefore, this study suggests that the combination of L. japonica and M. obovata extracts may be used as a plant-derived natural preservative. © 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.","Antimicrobial activity; Lonicera japonica; Magnolia obovata; Synergistic effect","caffeic acid; honokiol; Lonicera japonica extract; luteolin; Magnolia obovata extract; magnolol; methyl paraben; plant extract; unclassified drug; acetic acid; acetic acid ethyl ester; antiinfective agent; plant extract; antimicrobial activity; Article; Bacillus subtilis; Candida albicans; chemical composition; controlled study; disk diffusion; drug potentiation; high performance liquid chromatography; Lonicera japonica; Magnolia; Magnolia obovata; minimum bactericidal concentration; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; drug potentiation; isolation and purification; Lonicera; microbial sensitivity test; Acetates; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacteria; Candida albicans; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Synergism; Lonicera; Magnolia; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058878635

A model output statistics (MOS) method is used to downscale the daily rainfall of general circulation models (GCMs), and an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed for the disaggregation of projected daily rainfall to hourly maximum rainfall, which is then used for the development of IDF curves. Finally, the 1st quartiles, medians, and 3rd quartiles of projected rainfall intensities are estimated for developing IDF curves with uncertainty level. Eight GCM simulations under two radiative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios, namely, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, are used in the proposed framework for the projection of IDF curves with related uncertainties for peninsular Malaysia. The projection of rainfall revealed an increase in the annual average rainfall throughout the present century. The comparison of the projected IDF curves for the period 2006-2099 with that obtained using GCM hindcasts for the based period (1971-2005) revealed an increase in rainfall intensity for shorter durations and a decrease for longer durations. The uncertainty in rainfall intensity for different return periods for shorter duration is found to be 2 to 6 times more compared to longer duration rainfall, which indicates that a large increase in rainfall intensity for short durations projected by GCMs is highly uncertain for peninsular Malaysia.

If the development is successful, 4800 tons of MBD a year, approximately 1820 cars fully fueled annually, will be produced from 2019. Furthermore, the South Korean Government is expected to continue to invest in MBD to improve the market share after 2019. Quantitative information about the public value of MBD technology development is widely demanded by the Government. This study aims to investigate the public value of MBD technology, the attributes of which it considers to be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the mitigation of air pollutant emissions, new job creation, and the improvement of energy security.

The floor system is designed with a new type of composite panel with a polymeric material filling between the top and bottom steel plates. Its salient features are its light weight and simple installation that reduce structural materials and shorten the construction period. Experiments with various independent variables were performed to evaluate the flexural capacity of the proposed composite panel, and a finite element analysis was also conducted to examine the state of the stresses generated between the steel plate and the polymeric core. The test results showed that the proposed panel exhibited very ductile behavior and maintained its structural integrity even after a maximum load. No other failure mode than the face yielding of the top and bottom steel plates was observed. The bond strength between the polymeric material and the steel plates was confirmed to be sufficient, even without any special surface treatment or any additional shear connectors, to maintain the stability of the proposed panel and to resist the forces generated at the interface between the two materials.

Rheological and texture analyses indicated a stable gel network and that grafting and crosslinking density influenced the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The release behavior of NRG from the hydrogel could be explained by the Fickian diffusion mechanism. The hydrogel system enhanced transdermal delivery of NRG.

Gauge-based gridded monthly rainfall data of Global Precipitation Climatological Center (GPCC) is used as a reference for downscaling and projection of GCM rainfall at regular grid intervals. The obtained results reveal the ability of SVM-based MOS models to replicate the temporal variation and distribution of GPCC rainfall efficiently. The ensemble mean of selected GCM projections downscaled using MOS models show changes in annual precipitation in the range of −4.2% to 24.6% in Bangladesh under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Annual rainfalls are projected to increase more in the western part (5.1% to 24.6%) where average annual rainfall is relatively low, and less in the eastern part (−4.2 to 12.4%) where average annual rainfall is relatively high, which indicates more homogeneity in the spatial distribution of rainfall in Bangladesh in future.

To estimate the AAR, using rain gauge networks that are spatially well distributed is ideal. In this study, the spatial characteristics of the rain gauge networks for the five major river basins in South Korea are considered and the amount of influence the spatial distribution has on the estimation of the AAR is evaluated. For this purpose, the estimation error for AAR is calculated for two cases. The first case (Analysis 1) compares the value of the estimation error of the AAR from two different basins where one has well distributed rain gauges while the other does not. The second case (Analysis 2) estimates the estimation error of two different rain gauge distributions for the same basin. The spatial characteristic of the rain gauge network is evaluated by using the NNI (Nearest Neighbour Index), while the Arithmetic Mean Method, Thiessen Method and the Estimation Theory are applied to calculate the AAR. From Analysis 1, we are able to prove that the estimation error of the AAR is relatively small in the basins with that have spatially well distributed rain gauge networks whereas the estimation error is relatively large when the spatial distribution of the rain gauge network is clustered. Also, results from Analysis 2 showed that not only is the spatial distribution of the rain gauge networks important, but that the density has a significant influence on accurately calculating the AAR. The results from this study can be applied towards the ideal establishment of the rain gauge networks. © 2018 by the authors.","Areal Average Rainfall; Estimation Error Analysis; Nearest Neighbour Index; Rain gauge networks; Spatial distribution","Errors; Estimation; Rain; Rain gages; Water resources; Areal averages; Arithmetic mean method; Estimation errors; Estimation theory; Nearest neighbour; Rain gauge networks; Spatial characteristics; Thiessen methods; Spatial distribution; error analysis; index method; network analysis; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; raingauge; river basin; spatial distribution; water resource; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056403487

One change has been an increase in the penetration of sustainable energy. However, this can affect the reliability of power systems by increasing variability and uncertainty from the use of renewable resources. To improve the reliability of an energy supply, a power system must have a sufficient amount of flexible resources to prevent a flexibility deficit. This paper proposes a countermeasure for protecting nonnegative flexibility under high-level penetration of renewable energy with robust optimization. The proposed method is divided into three steps: (i) constructing an uncertainty set with the capacity factor of renewable energy, (ii) searching for the initial point of a flexibility deficit, and (iii) calculating the capacity of the energy storage system to avoid such a deficit. In this study, robust optimization is applied to consider the uncertainty of renewable energy, and the results are compared between deterministic and robust approaches. The proposed method is demonstrated on a power system in the Republic of Korea. © 2018 by the authors.","Deficit; Energy storage systems; Flexibility; Flexible resource; Renewable energy; Robust optimization; Uncertainty","alternative energy; energy resource; energy storage; optimization; renewable resource; uncertainty analysis; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056392838

However, it faces issues of tax avoidance, such as the black-market and missing trader intra-community fraud. Many studies have postulated that the introduction of the Reverse Charge System (RCS) will contribute to the enhancement of transparency and fairness in trade for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that supply goods or provide services. This study analyzes SME taxpayers' perception of transparency and fairness in trade resulting from the introduction of the RCS into the South Korean VAT system. In B2B transactions that handle gold, copper, and steel scrap, large companies often abuse their bargaining power over smaller firms by not paying VAT with their purchase or reducing the prices to equal VAT, leading to low trade transparency. When it comes to gold, copper and steel scrap trading, the imbalance in bargaining power results in one of the parties being unable to reap maximum benefits because of unfairness. SMEs with relatively weak bargaining power suffer from unfair trading practices such as price cutting and the imposition of VAT by their counterparts. Since the introduction of the RCS, however, SME taxpayers appear to believe that trade fairness has improved. This study's findings reveal that SMEs are more likely to perceive improvement in trade transparency and fairness since the implementation of the RCS, indicating that the RCS has exerted a positive influence on SMEs. This study provides important policy implications for countries that intend to implement the RCS by offering empirical evidence of its benefits. © 2018 by the authors.","Reverse Charge System; SME sustainability; Tax collection system; Trade fairness; Trade transparency; Value Added Tax","bargaining; black market; perception; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability; tax system; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056215863

The present study demonstrated that the herbal medicines Hepad 1 and 2 protected against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice and SH-SY5Y cells. Hepad 1 and 2 remarkably alleviated the enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, macrophage-1, and phosphorylated iκB-α) and apoptotic signals (Bcl-2-associated X protein, caspase-3, and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase-1). Additionally, Hepad reduced MPTP-induced oxidative damage by increasing the expression of anti-oxidant defense enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase) and downregulating the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4. This study also showed that the neuroprotective effects of Hepad include anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-oxidative properties, in addition to activation of the protein kinase B, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, oral administration of Hepad 1 and 2 attenuated the death of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive substantia nigra neurons that was induced by 20 mg/kg MPTP.

In this study, we developed a highly stretchable Ag conductor composed of Ag flakes and a polyester binder. We focused on the IR-curing technique to develop the stretchable Ag conductor, which was printed on the polyurethane elastomer substrate. The effects of the temperature and duration of curing on the electrical resistance and electromechanical properties of the Ag conductor were investigated. The electromechanical properties of the stretchable Ag conductor were evaluated in stretching, bending, and cyclic endurance tests. We achieved stretchable conductors with a low sheet resistance of 46 mΩ/sq., a superior stretchability of 150%, and a bending radius of 1 mm. The Ag conductor also exhibited outstanding mechanical durability in the cyclic stretching and bending endurance tests. In this study, the optimized IR-curing duration and temperature were 5 min and 130 °C, respectively. However, in future research, the curing duration could be further reduced by the optimization of the IR parameters. The results of the pencil hardness test and the peel-off adhesion test (i.e., the cross-cut test) indicated that the stretchable Ag conductor had excellent hardness and strength of adhesion between the conductor and the substrate. © 2018","Conductor; Nanocomposite; Polyester binder; Silver flake; Stretchable","Adhesion; Bending tests; Binders; Curing; Electric resistance; Hardness; Nanocomposites; Substrates; Conductor; Electrical resistances; Electromechanical property; Mechanical durability; Polyurethane elastomers; Stretchable; Stretchable conductors; Stretchable electronics; Durability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050249517

Previously, visually tolerable tiling (VTT) for fabricating nanopatterns for optical applications has been reported as a candidate for large area fabrication. The essence of VTT is the inevitable stitching of the nanoscale optical component, which is not seen by the naked eye if the boundary is very narrow while the tiles are overlapped. However, it had been difficult to control the shape of the spread of liquid prepolymers in the previous work, and there was room for the development of tiling. Here, we propose a method for transferring various shapes of tiles, which can be defined with a shadow mask. The method of using a transparent shadow mask can provide a wide process window, because it allows the spreading of a liquid prepolymer to be more easily controlled. We optimize the coating condition of a liquid prepolymer and the ultraviolet (UV) exposure time. Using this method, we can attach tiles of various shapes without a significant visible trace in the overlapped region. © 2018 by the authors.","Nanoimprint; Nanostructures; Polymer; Tiling; Transfer","Liquids; Monomers; Nanostructures; Polymers; Liquid prepolymers; Nano-imprint; Nano-scale patterns; Optical applications; Optical components; Tiling; Transfer; Ultraviolet exposure; Fabrication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056128132

To be used as the direct fabrication process, however, 3D printing should overcome drawbacks due to its lamination process: low dimensional accuracy, long fabrication time and degeneration of mechanical properties along the lamination direction. This degeneration along the lamination direction results in anisotropic mechanical properties, which prevents appropriate prediction of structural safety of the 3D-printed parts. This study investigated mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts using a mask-projection type (digital light processing; DLP) 3D printer by comparing tensile test results for the specimens that were printed along horizontal and vertical directions. By analyzing experimental results, appropriate printing conditions could be obtained to satisfy high mechanical strength and stiffness as well as to maintain mechanical properties within isotropic range. ©2018 The Polymer Society of Korea.

Recently a new way to save the model was suggested in the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model: If the Yukawa couplings of down-type fermions have the wrong sign, the contributions from t′ and b′ to κg are canceled. We study the theoretical and experimental constraints on this model, focusing on the heavy Higgs bosons. We point out two constraining features. First, the exact wrong-sign limit does not allow alignment, which causes the perturbative unitarity for the scalar-scalar scattering to put upper bounds on the heavy Higgs boson masses like MH, MA 920 GeV and MH± 620 GeV. Second, the Yukawa couplings of the fourth generation fermions to the heavy Higgs bosons are generically large, being proportional to the heavy fermion mass and, for the down-type fermions, to tanβ as well. The gluon fusion production of H and A through the fourth generation quark loops becomes significant. We find that the current LHC data on pp→ZZ for H, along with the theoretical and indirect constraints, exclude the model at leading order. © 2018 authors.

However, the relationship between religiosity and tax equity has not been studied actively. Especially in Korea, there has been considerable debate about the implementation of taxation for clergies. Therefore, the relationship between religiosity and tax equity will be analyzed clearly using Korean survey panel data.

The best way of predicting a response signal from a system is to use the sinusoidal extrapolation based on its frequency characteristics. Sinusoidal extrapolation is a statistical method for predicting future data through frequency analysis of past data. Practically speaking, the prediction from a frequency analysis in a control system is appropriate, because the output of a system can be modeled by several dominant frequencies from input and system models. In this study, we developed a novel and reliable prediction filter, using multi frequency sinusoidal extrapolation and a prediction error compensation algorithm. In this paper, we also suggest the design guidelines, regularity, and overall process of obtaining optimal predictions from an efficient and practical view, for the widely used industrial equipment.

An integral expression for local velocity is derived by introducing the concept of a core-flow rate at a point in the tube as the rate of the partial flow passing through a coaxially centered circular cross section with a radius equal to the radial position of that point. In this approach, the velocity is expressed as the difference between the mean core velocity from the core-flow rate and the mean velocity of the flow through a virtual tube with its wall at the corresponding radial position. First, this method has been verified using velocities for the Newtonian and power law models. Then, it has been applied to velocity calculations for fluids obeying the Carreau, Cross, and Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) models. Moreover, the velocity result for the Carreau model has been applied to the viscosity reconstruction by the inverse parameter estimation from the measured velocity. Specifically, for the PTT model case, the slip boundary condition has also been considered. The mean velocity of the virtual tube flow can be determined by the difference between the measured and the core velocities. Therefore, a measured velocity profile allows the acquisition of the apparent shear rates of many virtual tube flows. These virtual tube flows have different wall shear stresses because of the differences in radii despite having the same pressure gradient. With the apparent shear rate and the wall shear stress, the Rabinowitsch correction has been conducted to retrieve the true wall shear rate, which facilitates accurate estimation of the viscosity and the Reynolds number. It has been found that the obtained Reynolds number closely follows the generalized Reynolds number. © 2018 The Society of Rheology.",,"Laminar flow; Non Newtonian flow; Non Newtonian liquids; Pipe flow; Reynolds number; Shear deformation; Shear stress; Tubes (components); Velocity; Viscosity; Accurate estimation; Circular cross-sections; Non-Newtonian fluids; Phan-Thien Tanner models; Slip boundary conditions; Velocity calculations; Velocity profiles; Wall shear stress; Shear flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054322672

After pre-strain and thermal aging treatment in all the steels, the yield and tensile strengths, and yield ratio were increased, while the uniform elongation and work hardening exponent were decreased. In the case of the X80 steel, particularly, the decrease in uniform elongation was relatively small due to many mobile dislocations in PF, and the increase in yield ratio was the lowest because a large amount of harder microstructures such as GB, BF, and coarse secondary phases effectively enhanced work hardening. © 2018, The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials.","API pipeline steels; High deformability; Strain aging; Tensile properties; Yielding behavior",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051656079

A number of centralized attack detection mechanisms have been proposed to detect attacks in IoT, wherein an attack detection system is deployed at the central point in the network that collects data from the network and classifies it as “attack” or “normal” using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Note, however, that these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results due to the distinct requirements of IoT devices, such as scalability, distribution, resource limitations, and low latency. Moreover, the application of supervised machine learning for classification needs a significant amount of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a fog-based attack detection framework that relies on the fog computing paradigm and a newly proposed ELM-based Semi-supervised Fuzzy C-Means (ESFCM) method. As an extension of cloud computing, fog computing enables attack detection at the network edge and supports distributed attack detection. The ESFCM method uses a semi-supervised fuzzy c-means algorithm to handle the labeled data issue and an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm to provide good generalization performance at a faster detection rate. The evaluation was performed on the NSL-KDD dataset, demonstrating that the proposed framework achieved better performance than the centralized attack detection framework.

Analysis modeling was verified by comparing with existing test results of various cases, and parametric study results showed that design parameters have significant effects on minimum reinforcement (required to prevent yielding of longitudinal bars in service, which could be caused by creep and shrinkage effects), long-term effective flexural stiffness, and long-term ultimate strength. In particular, the minimum reinforcement could be either smaller or even greater than the current 1% requirement depending on design parameters, and in cases with high eccentricity/slenderness ratios, the premature yielding of longitudinal bars in service was more pronounced due to highly stressed concrete and additional second-order effects. Thus, for more rational design, a design equation for the minimum reinforcement was proposed covering concentrically and eccentrically loaded RC columns. On the other hand, a simple method of a design code (in which long-term effective flexural stiffness is approximated by reducing short-term effective flexural stiffness) reflected long-term effects quite well.

The element shape function based on the linear point interpolation leads to simple element formulation and a good geometric adaptability. Due to the properties of the smoothed finite element method, it is possible to connect non-matching meshes by polyhedral elements and provide seamless connection without overlapping or gap satisfying the interfacial conditions of continuity and force equilibrium, which is verified through the patch test.

Recent studies have shown that nanoscale coatings on carbon nanotubes increase the output and lifespan of these devices owing to the improvement of their mechanical and chemical properties. Among various coating methods, atomic layer deposition (ALD) can adjust the thickness of the coating layer conformally without any directional growth. Therefore, ALD can coat particles with high aspect ratios, such as CNFs, even at nanometer levels of thickness. In this work, we grew two different morphologies of a SnO2 layer on CNF. We used two types of ALD equipment: flow-type ALD (static ALD), and fluidized bed reactor-type ALD (dynamic ALD). Static ALD could form a discontinuous SnO2, while a uniform SnO2 layer was formed by pre-inserting a layer of Al2O3. On the other hand, dynamic ALD formed a uniform SnO2 layer without pre-insertion of an Al2O3 layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that both Sn4+ and Sn2+ were present in SnO2 on the CNF deposited by static ALD, probably due to the formation of an interfacial layer between the SnO2 and CNF. When the dynamic ALD method was used, only Sn4+ was present in the SnO2 on CNF. Cyclic voltammetry analysis was performed to characterize the electrochemical properties of the SnO2-coated CNF as an electrode on a direct methanol fuel cell. It was revealed that the discontinuous SnO2 on CNF deposited by static ALD showed the highest current efficiency as well as enhanced electrocatalytic stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Coating materials; Electrochemical reactions; Fuel cells; Nanostructured materials; Vapor deposition","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Aspect ratio; Carbon nanofibers; Chemical reactors; Coatings; Cyclic voltammetry; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Electrochemical electrodes; Fluid catalytic cracking; Fluidized beds; Fuel cells; Lithium-ion batteries; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Nanostructured materials; Vapor deposition; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Yarn; Coating material; Current efficiency; Directional growth; Electrochemical reactions; Fluidized bed reactors; Lithium ion secondary batteries; Methanol oxidation reactions; Nano-scale coatings; Atomic layer deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050480747

In addition, the reaction products of Ti2O3, Y, and Y2O3 powders were predicted approximately based on their formation enthalpy. The experimental results relating to the formation of Y-based complex oxides revealed that YTiO3 and Y2Ti2O7 were formed when Ti2O3 reacted with Y; in contrast, only Y2Ti2O7 was detected during the reaction between Ti2O3 and Y2O3. In the alloy of Fe–Cr–Y2O3 with Ti2O3, YTiO3 (formed by the reaction of Ti2O3 with Y) was detected after the MA and heat treatment processes were complete, even though Y2O3 was present in the system.

To alleviate this burden, dimensionality reduction has been applied to documents as a preprocessing step. Among dimensionality reduction algorithms, compared with feature selection, feature extraction can reduce information loss and achieve a higher discriminating power in sentiment classification. However, feature extraction suffers from lack of interpretability and many nonlinear extraction methods, which generally outperform linear methods, are not applicable for sentiment classification because of the characteristics that only provide corresponding low-dimensional coordinates without mapping. Therefore, this research proposes an improved semi-supervised dimensionality reduction framework that simultaneously preserves the advantages of feature extraction and addresses the drawbacks for sentiment classification. The proposed framework is mainly based on linear feature extraction providing mapping and feature weighting is applied before feature extraction. Feature weighting and extraction are conducted in a semi-supervised manner so that both label information and structural information of data can be considered. The superiority of both feature weighting and feature extraction was verified by conducting extensive experiments in six benchmark datasets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Feature extraction; Feature weighting; Natural language processing (NLP); Semi-supervised dimensionality reduction; Sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Data mining; Extraction; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Sentiment analysis; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction algorithms; Discriminating power; Feature weighting; Linear feature extraction; Pre-processing step; Sentiment classification; Structural information; Feature extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047330895

We overcome the added computational overhead originating from smooth dynamic constraints by adopting the recent first-order smooth optimization technique, adjusted for our problem instance.

The existing reliability predictions for the power electronics converter mainly focus on the metrics of lifetime, accumulated damage, constant failure rate, or mean time to failure. Nevertheless, the time-varying and probability-distributed characteristics of the reliability are rarely involved. Moreover, in the public literatures, there are few evidences showing that the accuracy of the predicted reliability was experimentally validated. In this paper, a more advanced metric 'cumulative distribution function (CDF)' is introduced to predict the reliability performance of the power electronics system based on mission profiles in motor drive application. Furthermore, the accuracy of the predicted reliability metrics is verified through a series of wear-out tests in a converter testing system. It is concluded that the CDF is a very suitable metric to predict the reliability performance of the converter, and it has shown good accuracy with much more reliability information compared to the existing approaches. In this method, the correct stress translation and dedicated strength tests based on mission profiles are two key factors to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of reliability prediction. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Cumulative distribution function; IGBT; life testing; lifetime estimation; mission profiles; power semiconductors; reliability; reliability prediction","Cost effectiveness; Distribution functions; Electric drives; Electric motors; Failure analysis; Forecasting; Measurement; Power converters; Power electronics; Power semiconductor devices; Reliability; Stresses; Testing; Thermal stress; Cumulative distribution function; Distributed characteristics; Motor drive; Motor drive applications; Power electronics converters; Power electronics systems; Reliability information; Reliability performance; Outages",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041285621

The modified version of Man-Kendall (m-MK) test which can discriminate the multi-scale variability from unidirectional trend was used along with Mann-Kendall (MK) test to confirm the trends in the presence of long-term persistence (LTP). The MK test revealed decrease in annual number of rainy days, heavy rainfall days, and consecutive wet days at 60, 53, and 47% stations, respectively, and the same indices during winter at 47, 47, and 33% stations, respectively. Significant decrease in annual and winter total rainfall was also found at a few stations. An increasing tendency in dry spell was observed due to the decrease in total rainfall and the number of rainy days; however, it was still not significant in most of the stations. The Student’s t test and F test revealed significant changes in daily rainfall mean and variability between two 30-year periods, 1965–1994 and 1986–2015. The m-MK test confirmed the results obtained using the MK test in most of the stations. However, the number of stations with significant change was found to decrease when the m-MK test was used.

Alloxazine is further modified by carboxylic acid (COOH) groups (alloxazine-COOH) to increase the aqueous solubility and to pursue a desirable shift in the redox potential. For obtaining a better AORFB performance, the overall redox reactivity of AORFB should be improved by the enhancement of the rate-determining reaction of the redox couple. A carboxylic acid-doped carbon nanotube (CA-CNT) catalyst is considered for increasing the reactivity. The utilization of CA-CNT allows for the induction of a better redox reactivity of alloxazine-COOH because of the role of COOH within alloxazine-COOH as a proton donor, the fortified hydrophilic attribute of alloxazine-COOH, and the increased number of active sites. With the assistance of these attributes, the mass transfer of aqueous alloxazine-COOH molecules can be promoted. However, CA-CNT does not have an effect on the increase of the redox reactivity of ferrocyanide because the redox reaction is not affected by the same influence of protons that the redox reactivity of alloxazine-COOH is affected by. Such a behavior is proven by measuring the electron transfer rate constant and diffusivity. With regard to AORFB full cell testing, when CA-CNT is used as a catalyst for the negative electrode, the performance of the AORFB increases. Specifically, the charge-discharge overpotential and infrared drop potential are improved. As a result, the voltage efficiency affected by the potentials increases to 64%. Furthermore, the discharging capacity reaches 26.7 A h·L-1, and the state of charge attains 83% even after 30 cycles. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","aqueous organic redox flow battery; carboxylic acid-doped carbon nanotube; ferrocyanide; modified alloxazine; rate-determining reaction of redox couple","Carboxylic acids; Charging (batteries); Cyanides; Flow batteries; Mass transfer; Nanocatalysts; Rate constants; Redox reactions; Yarn; Acid doped; Discharging capacity; Electron-transfer rate constants; ferrocyanide; modified alloxazine; Number of active sites; Redox couple; Voltage efficiencies; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055336658

The combination of the two parameters is optimized using response surface methodology with statistical approach. The optional presence of methylene blue as mediator is also included for comparison. Experimental dataset is initially built as reference and 4 mathematical equations are derived to predict the response regarding open circuit voltage (OCV) and maximum power density (MPD).

In this paper, monitoring drowsiness is investigated in which five healthy volunteers participated in an experiment to elicit drowsiness. The subjects were asked to limit their sleep duration to only two to three hours and restrict caffeine intake during the 24 hours prior to the experiment. In the experiment, a one-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) and a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) were simultaneously recorded. The ECG and EEG features were extracted and fed into machine learning, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine algorithms. Various feature combinations were utilized to train the algorithms, and random forest yielded the best performance at about 90% accuracy, precision, and recall, with 10-second epochs in the ECG and EEG.

However, some rural areas such as in Maluku and Papua Islands still have low electrification ratio (~70%). One of the main problems in supplying electricity to rural areas in Indonesia is the geographical concern which consisted of islands leading to the difficulty of electricity grid development. In some areas, diesel power plant has been being built to supply the electricity. However, it causes another problem to transport the primary energy source to the targeted area which would increase the cost of electricity supply. Besides, it also needs investment cost to build transmission and distribution systems, as well as the maintenance expenses. To resolve this issue, a new scheme of battery-based Tabung Listrik or TaLis (DC-based power bank) and DC house system is proposed to be the solution to provide electricity to rural areas. The potential of local renewable energy sources such as biomass, hydro, wind, and solar could be utilized to be charging sources of batteries (TaLis). This study presents the TaLis prototype, DC house installation, supply chain process and charging scheme of TaLis, and cost comparison between the proposed system with other existing power systems such as communal PV farm and diesel power plant. We found that TaLis and DC house system provided the least cost of electricity production compared to other power systems, i.e. $0.88/kWh for TaLis and DC house system, $1.65/kWh for diesel power plant, and $1.47/kWh for communal PV farm. Implementation of this approach is expected to improve the welfare and quality of life of rural communities immediately. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Charging (batteries); Costs; Diesel power plants; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Houses; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Supply chains; Cost comparisons; Cost of electricity; Electricity grids; Investment costs; Maintenance expense; Primary energy source; Supply chain process; Transmission and distribution systems; Rural areas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056821416

To overcome this, existing studies have proposed motorized steerable surgical instruments, but they do not provide haptic feedback and intuitive understanding of the position of the end-effector. In this paper, we developed a motorless steerable arthroscopic surgery instrument. It was designed with the ergonomic aspects for intuitive manipulation.

To this end, conductive textiles and paper have been highlighted, as their porous structures can accommodate the stress built during various physical motions. However, fabrics with plain weaves or knit structures have been mostly adopted without exploration of nonwoven counterparts. Also, the integration of conductive materials, such as carbon or metal nanomaterials, to achieve sufficient conductivity as current collectors is not well-aligned with large-scale processing in terms of cost and quality control. Here, the superiority of nonwoven fabrics is reported in electrochemical performance and bending capability compared to currently dominant woven counterparts, due to smooth morphology near the fiber intersections and the homogeneous distribution of fibers. Moreover, solution-processed electroless deposition of aluminum and nickel–copper composite is adopted for cathodes and anodes, respectively, demonstrating the large-scale feasibility of conductive nonwoven platforms for wearable rechargeable batteries. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, an enzyme-sticker-based approach that enables flexible and multielectrochemical sensors via simple contact-transfer printing is reported. The enzyme sticker consists of an enzymatic conductive network film and a polymeric support. The enzyme-incorporated nanostructured conductive network showing an efficient electrical coupling was assembled via the hydrodynamic layer-by-layer assembly of redox enzymes, polyelectrolytes, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and a biological glue material, M13 phage. The enzymatic conductive network on a polymeric membrane support was facilely wet contact-transfer printed onto integrated electrode systems by exploiting varying degrees of hydrophilicity displayed by the enzymatic electronic film, polymeric support, and receiving electrodes of the sensor system. The glucose sensors fabricated using the enzyme sticker detected glucose at a concentration of as low as 35 μM and showed high selectivity and stability. Furthermore, a flexible dual-sensor array capable of detecting both glucose and lactate was demonstrated using the versatile enzyme sticker concept.

This study examines social acceptance for cancelling the construction of planned nuclear power plants (NPPs) and replacing them with other energy sources. The contingent valuation method (CVM) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are used to access the social acceptance and financial feasibility of such projects. Empirical analysis is based on the case of South Korea, where a similar policy is in progress under the new government. The CVM results show that a Korean household was willing to pay an additional KRW 1922.45/month (USD 1.80/month) for replacing seven 1-Gigawatt NPPs with other energy sources, which is about 3.5% of a household's current electricity bill. The CBA suggests that the annual costs of replacing this amount of nuclear power capacity with renewables or liquefied natural gas is KRW 1291.40 billion (USD 1.21 billion) or KRW 1180.38 billion (USD 1.11 billion) larger than its benefits, which amounts to about 3% of total annual electricity generation costs in South Korea. As the additional costs of nuclear power replacement cannot be fully covered by the mean willingness-to-pay of the current acceptance level, moderate levels of social resistance are expected if all the additional costs are passed on to the end-users. © 2018 by the authors.","Contingent valuation method; Liquefied natural gas; Nuclear power; Renewable energy; Social acceptance; Willingness to pay","alternative energy; contingent valuation; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; energy policy; environmental economics; feasibility study; financial system; liquefied natural gas; nuclear power plant; public attitude; willingness to pay; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055504109

SPRG materials are typically required to undergo a screw-mixing process to temporarily reduce the high viscosity and facilitate membrane installation on a concrete surface. However, there is no standard regulation on the duration of screw-mixing time during SPRG construction. Reported construction cases indicate that SPRG are left under constant screw mixing and are reused after hours or days of rest without being replaced with fresh products. When installed in this condition, SPRGs are subject to waterproofing performance degradation. In this study, SPRG viscosity properties are measured after five different screw-mixing procedures (no screw mixing, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min) and are set to rest in storage (2 h, 1, 2, 3, and 7 days). Specimens prepared under the respective screw mixing and storage times are evaluated for their changes in waterproofing properties through a series of ISO TS 16774 standard evaluation methods. A correlative comparison of the property evaluation results is presented to provide the changes to SPRG property and waterproofing performance. These results are then used to propose a general guideline for selecting optimal screw-mixing time with respect to maintaining adequate waterproofing performance and the viscosity recovery property of SPRG. © 2018 by the authors.","Complex waterproofing method; Concrete crack; Concrete waterproofing; Screw mixing; Storage time; Synthetic polymerized rubber gel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055178938

Since the time component of this term, θjB0, equals θnB for a spatially homogeneous current, it is usually argued that this term implies a splitting in the energy of baryons and antibaryons, thereby providing an effective chemical potential for baryon number. In thermal equilibrium, one then obtains nB∼θT2. We however argue that a term of this form in the Lagrangian does not contribute to the single particle energies of baryons and antibaryons. We show this for both fermionic and scalar baryons. However, similar to some recent work, we find that despite the above result the baryon number density obtained from a Boltzmann equation analysis can be proportional to θT2. Our arguments are very different from that in the standard literature on spontaneous baryogenesis. © 2018 authors.

Hence, one can get a complete analytic description of gauged solitons in (3+1) dimensions living within a finite volume in terms of classic results in the theory of differential equations and Kummer's confluent functions. We consider here two types of gauged solitons: gauged Skyrmions and gauged time crystals (namely, gauged solitons periodic in time, whose time period is protected by a winding number). The dependence of the energy of the gauged Skyrmions on the baryon charge can be determined explicitly. The theory of Kummer's confluent functions leads to a quantization condition for the period of the time crystals. Likewise, the theory of Sturm-Liouville operators gives rise to a quantization condition for the volume occupied by the gauged Skyrmions. The present analysis also discloses that resurgent techniques are very well suited to deal with the gauged Skyrme model as well. In particular, we discuss a very nice relation between the electromagnetic perturbations of the gauged Skyrmions and the Mathieu equation which allows to use many of the modern resurgence techniques to determine the behavior of the spectrum of these perturbations. © 2018 authors.

In the ORP scheme, a precoding matrix consisting of orthogonal vectors is utilized at the transmitter, which provides beamforming gains to enhance the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receivers. In this study, the ability of the ORP scheme with MMSE receivers to extend the cell coverage and its sum-rate performance for cell-edge users are investigated. In particular, we first derive the approximate distribution of the maximum SINR at the output of the MMSE receiver. Then, to analyze and optimize the ORP scheme with MMSE receivers in terms of coverage and sum-rate performance, the analytical expressions for the downlink coverage probability and sum rate are derived. It is shown that there is a tradeoff between coverage and sum-rate performance in the ORP scheme. In particular, a smaller number of precoding vectors provides larger coverage; however, it leads to a lower sum rate. To achieve optimal tradeoff between coverage and sum rate for the ORP scheme, we propose using multiple random precoder groups over multiple time slots. It is shown that the proposed scheme is capable of significantly enhancing coverage performance while preserving an acceptable sum rate for cell-edge users. The simulation results validate the analytical findings. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Cell coverage; massive MIMO; millimeter wave; random precoding","Array processing; Cells; Communication channels (information theory); Cytology; Mean square error; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; Radio receivers; Receivers (containers); Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Wave interference; Array signal processing; Cell coverage; Downlink; Massive MIMO; MIMO communication; Precoding; Random pre-coding; Signal receivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052824269

Urea and ammonium carbonate were used as both precipitating and mineralizing agent. In all cases, the adopted powder composition was Ce0.8Sm0.16 ×0.04O1.9-δ, where X was either Ca, Sr, Er or Pr and δ is 0 for trivalent cations (i.e. Er and Pr) or 0.02 for divalent cations (i.e. Ca and Sr). The effects of different synthesis parameters on powders morphology and crystalline phases have been pointed out. Differently synthesized powders underwent structural and morphological transformations during the hydrothermal treatment leading to different crystalline precursors for the desired co-doped ceria nanopowders, i.e. crystallized into the fluorite-like cubic structure after a calcination step at 700 °C for 1 h. The final properties of the calcined powders are strongly related to the corresponding parent powder features, consequently determining different sintering behaviours in the various pellets. In particular, except for Er/Sm co-doped ceria, all samples synthesized with ammonium carbonate as precipitating/mineralizing agent exhibited excellent sintering behaviour, with remarkable values of relative density (higher than 97% and up to 99.4%) and an almost ideal microstructure. Definitely, the present work gives several guidelines in terms of synthesis parameters and conditions to produce, with a relatively simple and cheap process, highly reactive co-doped ceria nanopowders with tuned properties and suitable as electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Carbonate environment; Co-doped ceria; Hydrothermal treatment; Nanopowders; Sintering","Binary alloys; Calcination; Carbonates; Carbonation; Cerium alloys; Cerium oxide; Coprecipitation; Crystalline materials; Erbium; Fluorspar; Nanostructured materials; Positive ions; Powders; Samarium; Samarium alloys; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Urea; Co-doped cerias; Hydrothermal treatments; Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell; Mineralizing agents; Nano powders; Samarium doped cerias; Structural and morphological transformations; Synthesis parameters; Sintering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049348521

By measuring the swelling ratios pH and temperature sensitivity were confirmed, and it was influenced by the content of a cross-linking agent. As a result of texture analysis and rheometry, a IPN hydrogel with 3% crosslinker content had the most adhesive and stable cross-linked network. Therefore, luteolin was loaded on this hydrogel. Its drug release behavior was determined at various temperatures and pH using several drug release kinetic models. As a result of skin permeation study, HA/PNIPAM IPN hydrogel effectively delivers luteolin to the epidermis and dermis.

The key idea of this work is to combine the high proton-conducting property of sPEEK and low vanadium permeability of PVdF by introducing the amphiphilic UAN to the immiscible blend of sPEEK and PVdF, UAN makes the two polymers miscible. The blend membranes are characterized by water uptake, dimensional change, proton conductivity, vanadium ion permeability, and cross-sectional morphology. By introducing small amounts of UAN (1–2 wt%) to the sPEEK/PVdF blend, proton conductivity increases, while vanadium permeability shows a very small change, resulting in higher proton selectivity against vanadium ion transport. Therefore, VRFBs employing the sPEEK/PVdF/UAN blend membrane exhibit significant improvements in discharge capacity and energy efficiency (EE) in comparison with those based on the sPEEK/PVdF blend and even with a Nafion 212 membrane. These results show that UAN-assisted compatible sPEEK/PVdF/UAN blend membranes can be useful for enhancing the VRFB performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amphiphilic polymer; Blend membrane; Compatibilizer; Ion exchange membrane; Ionic conductivity; Redox flow battery","Compatibilizers; Composite membranes; Energy efficiency; Ethers; Fluorine compounds; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Ionic conductivity; Ions; Ketones; Membranes; Polymers; Proton conductivity; Vanadium; Amphiphilic polymers; Blend membranes; Cross-sectional morphology; Poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF); Sulfonated polyetheretherketone; Vanadium ion permeabilities; Vanadium permeabilities; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048711150

While varying the concentration of the depletion agent (polyethylene glycol), three different systems are studied: pure malachite, pure silica and a 1:1 mass ratio of malachite and silica binary system. We find that the recovery increases significantly as the concentration of the depletion reagents increases for all three systems. However, the recovery suddenly decreases in a certain concentration range, which corresponds to the onset of the decreased surface tension when high concentrations of the depletion agent are used. The decreased surface tension of the air/water interface suggests that the recovery rate is lowered due to the adsorption of the depletion agent to the bubble surface, acting as a polymer brush. We also perform experiments in the presence of a small amount of a collector, sodium oleate. An extremely small amount of the collector (10-10-10-5 M) leads to the increase in the overall recovery, which eventually reaches nearly 100 percent. Nevertheless, the grade worsens as the depletant provides the force to silica particles as well as target malachite particles. © 2018 by the authors.

In this article, we propose a theoretical model that explains how this attractive interaction could enhance flotation efficiency. Two optimum conditions are determined for the concentration and molecular weight of the depletion agent. The optimum concentration can be determined through the extent of surface activity of the depletion agents. The magnitude of the depletion attraction increases as the concentration increases; however, an increase in the concentration simultaneously enhances its surface concentration. The bubble surface adsorption of the depletion agent results in polymer brushes on the bubble surface that produce a large repulsive interaction. In contrast, the optimal molecular weight of the depletion agents is given by the interaction between the depletion agent sizes, which is determined by its molecular weight and Debye length which is determined by the solution ionic strength. We demonstrate that exploiting this depletion interaction could significantly enhance the flotation efficiency and in principal could be used for any particle system. © 2018 by the authors.

This article applies a choice experiment to evaluate quantitatively the value given by people to the attributes of the installation of small-scale SPV power plants. To reflect the preference heterogeneity of South Korean people, a Bayesian estimation of a mixed-logit model is successfully performed. According to the results, South Korean people consider the electricity bill, the operating body, and the installation location as being more important than other attributes. The respondents prefer small-scale SPV power plants that are located in residential areas, have a large scale of installation, are operated by a private corporation and produce electricity for self-consumption. For these attributes, the South Korean people are willing to pay an additional electricity bill of South Korean won (KRW) 4286/month, KRW 3712/kW, KRW 2885/month and KRW 3731/month, respectively. The results provide meaningful implications regarding the aspects of installation on which the government should focus. In addition, the results can be utilized in policy making and decision making related to the installation of small-scale SPV power plants. © 2018 by the authors.","Discrete choice model; Heterogeneity; Renewable energy; Stated preference technique; Willingness to pay","Swinepox virus (STRAIN KASZA)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054563995

The industrially compatible development of these emerging materials is indispensable to facilitate the transition of 2D metal dichalcogenides from the research stage to the practical industrial application stage. However, an industrially relevant method, i.e., the low-temperature synthesis of wafer-scale, continuous, and orientation-controlled 2D metal dichalcogenides, still remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the low-temperature (≤350 °C) synthesis of uniform and continuous n-type SnS2 thin films via the combination of atomic layer deposition (ALD) of tin oxides and subsequent sulfurization. Well-crystallized and aligned SnS2 layers parallel to the substrate are demonstrated through the phase engineering of the ALD-grown tin oxide and the substrate surface. The additional H2S plasma treatment at 300 °C leads to the formation of stoichiometric SnS2. The formation of conformal SnS2 layers over a three-dimensional undulating hole structure is confirmed, which reveals the potential for applications beyond the planar structured architecture.

However, due to the poor ionic diffusion capability for Li ions during the cycling, the low ultrafast performance for energy storage remains rather limited. In the present study, aiming to improve the ionic diffusion capability for Li ions, we suggest a novel design of the debossed structure of carbon and Sn nanocomposites by electrospinning, carbonization, and the debossing process. The electrode based on the debossed structure exhibits a noticeable cycling stability and high discharge capacity (677 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1), an excellent rate capability (482 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1), and an outstanding ultrafast cycling stability (275 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2000 mA g−1). Therefore, this novel design of the debossed structure based on carbon and Sn nanocomposites offers attractive effects, such as the effective accommodation of dramatic volume changes for the Sn nanoparticles, as well as an improved ionic diffusion performance of Li ions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Debossed structure; Ionic diffusion; Li-ion battery; Nanocomposites","Anodes; Carbon; Carbonization; Diffusion in solids; Ions; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Carbon nanocomposite; Cycling stability; Discharge capacities; High electrical conductivity; Ionic diffusion; Lithium storages; Mechanical durability; Rate capabilities; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048380683

In particular, we characterized the interfacial stress level and mechanics between the SiO2 substrate and the anchors during the retrieval process. We also manipulated the configuration of the corner of the SiO2 substrate to develop a reliable transfer printing process, which resulted in a high transfer yield with no distortion or fracture of the SiO2 patterns.

Among many techniques, citation network analysis has been actively used for identifying technological trajectory. Even if there have been numerous studies to employ citation network to analyze technological evolution, it still remains a void in the literature how to differentiate each citation's role in technology evolution network. Generally, a paper or patent cites twenty to thirty references. However, most studies consider the importance of these citations as homogeneous, with less consideration on the importance of each individual citation. This can cause significant misleading for technological evolution analysis. Even if some studies tried to employ content-based citation analysis, these still remain conceptual. In response, this study suggests a new approach to analyzing technology evolution network by reflecting the role of each citation, considering both structural and semantic perspectives. For this purpose, we use natural language processing and machine learning technique to identify the importance of each citation by analyzing descriptive styles and semantic meanings. Thus, how each citation differs in terms of mediating technological knowledge flow can be measured, considering the frequency, structural position, and descriptive styles of each citation. Using different weight of each citation, a new way of network analysis is suggested to analyze technology evolution. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

For this purpose, today’s commercial drones use the difference between two GPS data in the drone and user-side mobile GCS, e.g. a smartphone, but the targeting performance is often not satisfactory due to the inaccuracy of the GPS data, ranging from a few to tens of meters. Visual tracking can be considered for a solution to this problem, but the reliability of visual tracking is still questionable for long-term tracking in un-expected operating environments. The paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the high accuracy of a visual tracking algorithm in short-term tracking and the reliability of GPS-based one in long-term tracking. The experiment with our prototype drone system demonstrates that the proposed combined approach can accomplish the follow-me operation very successfully, capturing the target in the center of video contents over 50% higher accuracy than the GPS-based ones.

Six kinds of ferrite-pearlite steel specimens are fabricated with the addition of different amounst of Mn and V and with varying the isothermal transformation temperature. The Mn steel specimen with a highest Mn content has the highest pearlite volume fraction because Mn addition inhibits the formation of ferrite. The V steel specimen with a highest V content has the finest ferrite grain size and lowest pearlite volume fraction because a large amount of ferrite forms in fine austenite grain boundaries that are generated by the pinning effect of many VC precipitates. On the other hand, the room-temperature tensile test results show that the V steel specimen has a longer yield point elongation than other specimens due to the highest ferrite volume fraction. The V specimen has the highest yield strength because of a larger amount of VC precipitates and grain refinement strengthening, while the Mn specimen has the highest tensile strength because the highest pearlite volume fraction largely enhances work hardening. Furthermore, the tensile strength increases with a higher transformation temperature because increasing the precipitate fraction with a higher transformation temperature improves work hardening. The results reveal that an increasing transformation temperature decreases the yield ratio. Meanwhile, the yield ratio decreases with an increasing ferrite grain size because ferrite grain size refinement largely increases the yield strength. However, the uniform elongation shows no significant changes of the microstructural factors. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Deformability; Ferrite-pearlite; Microstructural factor; Steel; Strength","Deformation; Ferrite; Formability; Grain boundaries; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Pearlite; Pearlitic transformations; Steel; Steel research; Strain hardening; Tensile testing; Volume fraction; Yield stress; Austenite grain boundaries; Ferrite-pearlite; Grain refinement strengthening; Isothermal transformations; Microstructural factors; Strength; Transformation temperatures; Yield point elongations; Tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059201023

On the other hand, the government recently announced the change of energy paradigm focusing on eco-friendly power generation from the base power generation through 8th Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand(BPE). In this study, we analyzed the quantitative effects of profit and loss on the CHP operating business by changing patterns of the heat production, caused by the change of energy paradigm. To do this, the power market long-term simulation was carried out according to the 7th and 8th BPE respectively, using the commercialized power market integrated analysis program. In addition, the CHP operating model is organized to calculate the power and heat production level for each CHP operation mode by utilizing the operating performance of 830MW class CHP in Seoul metropolitan area. Based on this, the operation optimization is performed for realizing the maximum operating profit and loss during the life-cycle of CHP through the commercialized integrated energy optimization program. As a result, it can be seen that the change of the energy paradigm of the government increased the level of the ordered power supply by Korean Power Exchange(KPX), decreased the cost of the heat production, and increased the operating contribution margin by 90.9 billion won for the 30 years. © 2018 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Though the recognition rate of BNNs is lower than the conventional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), BNNs have attracted many interests nowadays, because BNNs do not need the complicated multiplication such as DNNs. Binary memristor crossbars can be very suitable to realize BNN hardware. This is because, in memristor BNNs, simple binary operation can be performed in bitwise manner for all the columns in memristor crossbars, simultaneously. In this paper, single-column and double-column memristor BNNs are presented, respectively. In addition, ReLU and sigmoid activation function circuits are also proposed with CMOS circuits. The designed Memristor-CMOS hybrid circuits of BNNs have been tested for MNIST vectors. The memristor BNNs could recognize almost 90% MNIST digits when the memristance variation is as large as 25%. For variation tolerance, the memristor BNNs are compared with the multi-valued memristor neural networks such as 4-bit, 6-bit, etc, in this paper. As a result, it has been confirmed the memristor BNNs become more variation-tolerant than the multi-valued memristor NNs when the variation becomes larger than 22%. Comparing the single-column and double-column BNNs in this paper indicates that the single-column BNN can save power consumption and array area almost by half than the double-column. This is because the single-column has just half memristors than the double-column. And, we measured the single-column and double-column BNNs using the fabricated memristor array. In this measurement, both the double-column and single-column BNNs were observed to work well. © 2018, Institute of Electronics Engineers of Korea.

In South Korea, the incidence of ground subsidence in urban areas has increased in recent years and the number of underground cavities suspected of causing such events has significantly increased. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques to prevent the occurrence of underground and ground subsidence. In this study, a field test, laboratory test, and numerical analysis were conducted to determine the optimal compaction degree of the upper support layer of any underground cavity below the level of sewer pipes in order to prevent such cavities from collapsing and leading to ground subsidence accidents. During the field test, an underground cavity was simulated using ice, and the generation of the cavity was confirmed using ground penetrating radar. The ground investigation was performed using a cone penetration test, and the compaction of the ground where ground subsidence occurred was evaluated with a laboratory test. The behaviour of the ground under various conditions was predicted using a numerical analysis based on the data obtained from the field test and previous studies.

The current control scheme consists of full-state feedback control to stabilize the system and integral control terms to track the reference in the presence of disturbance and uncertainty. In addition, the current controller is augmented with resonant control terms to mitigate the harmonic component. The control scheme is implemented in the synchronous reference frame (SRF) to effectively compensate two harmonic orders at the same time by using only one resonant term. Moreover, to tackle the frequency variation issue in grid voltage, the frequency information which is extracted from the phase-locked loop (PLL) block is processed by a moving average filter (MAF) for the purpose of eliminating the frequency fluctuation caused by the harmonically distorted grid voltage. The filtered frequency information is employed to synthesize the resonant controller, even in the environment of frequency variation. To implement full-state feedback control for a grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter, all the state variables should be available. However, the increase in number of sensing devices leads to the rise of cost and complexity for hardware implementation. To overcome this challenge, a discrete-time full-state current observer is introduced to estimate all the system states. When the grid frequency is subject to variation, the discrete-time implementation of the observer in the SRF requires an online discretization process because the system matrix in the SRF includes frequency information. This results in a heavy computational burden for the controller. To resolve such a difficulty, a discrete-time observer in the stationary reference frame is employed in the proposed scheme. In the stationary frame, the discretization of the system model can be accomplished with a simple offline method even in the presence of frequency variation since the system matrix does not include the frequency. To select desirable gains for the full-state feedback controller and full-state observer, an optimal linear quadratic control approach is applied. To validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed frequency-adaptive control, simulation and experimental results are presented. © 2018 by the authors.","Frequency-adaptive control; Grid-connected inverter; Harmonic compensation; LCL filter; Linear quadratic regulator; Stationary frame observer","Adaptive control systems; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Feedback control; Hardware; Harmonic analysis; Information filtering; Linear control systems; Matrix algebra; Phase locked loops; Resonance; State feedback; Adaptive Control; Grid connected inverters; Harmonic compensation; LCL filters; Linear quadratic regulator; Stationary frame; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056077384

To utilize efficient perovskite-based tandem devices, parasitic absorption from buffer layers should be minimized. Here, we demonstrated an infrared (IR)-transparent perovskite PV employing ultra-thin buffer layers. Since vacuum-deposited layers follow underlying structure, thermally evaporated thin buffer layer (<15 nm) successfully covers perovskite film. These thin buffer layers provide selective carrier transport to the electrode because of their high energy barrier (>1 eV) compared to active layer. Moreover, as a result of reduced parasitic absorption, the transmittance of device with thin buffer layers is over 80% at near IR region (800-1100 nm), which allows low energy photons to penetrate top cell of tandem device. The engineering of a top perovskite PV and stacking it with commercialized silicon PVs lead to 19.4% (four-terminal) efficient tandem devices. © 2018 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.",,"Energy harvesting; Optical waveguides; Perovskite; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Active Layer; Deposited layer; High-energy barriers; Low energy photons; Low-cost energy; Near-IR regions; Perovskite films; Tandem devices; Buffer layers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055277493

The evaluation methods of the impulse swirl meter (ISM) and the particle image velocimetry (PIV) are compared. A straight port and a helical port were applied to the combustion chamber and the swirl was evaluated with ISM and PIV from 1.75B, (1.75 times the bore position apart from the bottom of head), to 6.00B positions. The comparison showed that the ISM evaluation was higher than the PIV, and the ISM evaluation decreases as the measuring position shifts downstream regardless of the shape of the port. The decrease in the helical port was larger than that of the straight one. PIV evaluation also slightly increases to 3.00B regardless of port shape, and then decreases. However, as the evaluation position shifts downstream, the ISM assessment is significantly reduced though the decrease in the PIV assessment is relatively small, thereby reducing the difference between the two assessments. The significant reduction in swirl according to the assessment location in the ISM method is due to the increase in wall friction and the overestimation due to the assumption of the ISM evaluation in the upstream being resolved downstream by the flow development. When considering the steady flow characteristics and the flow of the actual engine at the same time, the position of 5.00-6.00B is suitable for consistent evaluation. © 2018 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers","Eccentricity; Impulse Swirl Meter; PIV; Steady Flow Bench Semi-Wedge Combustion Chamber; Straight Port Helical Port; Swirl Flow; Velocity Profile","Combustion chambers; Engines; Velocity measurement; Eccentricity; Evaluation methods; Flow charac-teristics; Flow development; Particle image velocimetries; Straight Port Helical Port; Swirl flow; Velocity profiles; Steady flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054602883

The microscratch test was performed on a single-layer graphene by linearly increasing normal load from 0 to 200 mN. The Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to locally measure surface potential in the tested surface to quantitatively measure the area of damage of graphene layer. The nanoscale wear test results showed two stages of damage of graphene layer; a steady increase at low loads and a relatively rapid increase at high loads.

Click chemistry offers the much-needed multifunctional hydrogel materials which are interesting biomaterials for the tissue engineering and bioprinting inks applications owing to their excellent ability to form hydrogels with printability instantly and to retain the live cells in their 3D network without losing the mechanical integrity even under swollen state. Methods:: In this review, we present the recent developments of in situ hydrogel in the field of click chemistry reported for the tissue engineering and 3D bioinks applications, by mainly covering the diverse types of click chemistry methods such as Diels–Alder reaction, strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions, thiol-ene reactions, oxime reactions and other interrelated reactions, excluding enzyme-based reactions. Results:: The click chemistry-based hydrogels are formed spontaneously on mixing of reactive compounds and can encapsulate live cells with high viability for a long time. The recent works reported by combining the advantages of click chemistry and 3D bioprinting technology have shown to produce 3D tissue constructs with high resolution using biocompatible hydrogels as bioinks and in situ injectable forms. Conclusion:: Interestingly, the emergence of click chemistry reactions in bioink synthesis for 3D bioprinting have shown the massive potential of these reaction methods in creating 3D tissue constructs. However, the limitations and challenges involved in the click chemistry reactions should be analyzed and bettered to be applied to tissue engineering and 3D bioinks. The future scope of these materials is promising, including their applications in in situ 3D bioprinting for tissue or organ regeneration. © 2018, The Korean Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Society and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","3D bioprinting; Click chemistry; Hydrogels; Regenerative medicine; Tissue engineering","Biocompatibility; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cycloaddition; Hydrogels; Regenerative Medicine; Synthesis (chemical); Tissue; Tissue engineering; Azide-alkyne cycloaddition; Bioprinting; Click chemistry; Enzyme-based reactions; Injectable hydrogels; Mechanical integrity; Three dimensional (3D) structures; Tissue engineering applications; Tissue regeneration",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054186608

Wise policy decisions require information about the monetary value of noise-control policies. This study elicited people’s willingness to pay (WTP) for noise policies, separating traffic noise from residential noise to compare the value of controlling different types of noise. The contingent valuation method was used for the empirical analysis, with data from South Korea. The results show that the monthly mean WTP of respondents was KRW 3392.3 for residential noise reduction and KRW 3507.1 for transport noise reduction; thus, the WTP for the latter is slightly higher than that for the former.

The spray structure for delivering the relevant functional material is involved in the process of binding and dissolving the PR (photoresist) material. This presents an efficient spraying process of removing the photoresist layer formed on a 260-nm-thick indium tin oxide substrate with a CD (cyclodextrine)-drived aqueous stripper, simultaneously implementing proper mass transfer and heat transfer. It was taken to achieve an economical stripper consumption management by limiting the modified Weber number to 200 and the spray distance to 100 mm. As a result, stable removal performance was achieved, with optical and electric properties varying within the range of 1%, in CD drived aqueous stripping conditions (water content of the stripper composition ≤71%, stripper temperature = 40°C, and stripping time = 40 s). © 2018 Korean Chemical Society, Seoul & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, we have investigated the immobilization of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) on granular activated carbon (GAC) for the purpose of providing redox reactivity towards water pollutants. Two representative processes for nZVI immobilization on granular activated carbon (GAC/Fe) were evaluated, and concluded by the suggestion of optimized conditions for synthesizing GAC/Fe composites. Both total iron content and Fe0 content can be significantly influenced by the preparation process; therefore, it was important to avoid oxidation during preparation, to achieve the highest possible reduction capacity. The optimal condition for producing reactive GAC/Fe was determined to be immersing GAC in a Fe2+ solution for 24 h, followed by the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe0 without an intermediate drying step. The reactivity of prepared GAC/Fe was tested by evaluating nitrate reduction; in addition, the effect of acid addition was investigated. A colorimetric assay was applied to quantify the reaction products, whereupon the effectiveness of the colorimetric assay was well verified. Ultimately, the prepared GAC/Fe composite demonstrated a synergistic effect between the adsorption capability of the GAC and the degradation capability of the nZVI, which make this composite a very effective material for environmental remediation. © 2018, University of Tehran.","Granular activated carbon; Immobilization; Iron impregnation; Nanoscale zero-valent iron; Oxidation–reduction","activated carbon; chemosynthesis; granular medium; immobilization; iron nanoparticle; oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052643702

Compared to the sample without AlN, the interface state density obtained from the capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements was found to decrease with a 7.4 nm thick AlN. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, the sample with a 0.7 nm thick AlN showed dominant peaks related with oxygen bonds (Al–O and In–O). For the sample with a 7.4 nm thick AlN, the dominant peak near the AlN/InP interface was associated with Al–O and N–In bonds whereas it was associated with Al–N bonds near the AlN surface. In addition, the strong emission peaks associated with Al–O bonds were observed across the AlN layer, which indicates that some part of AlN layer is composed of Al–O bonds (like Al2O3).

In this study, the inhibitory effects of dehydroglyasperin C (DGC), an useful component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (G. uralensis), was investigated on melanogenesis induced by α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and its mechanisms. Methods: Melanogenesis suppression effect of DGC on α-MSH induced B16F1 melanoma cells. The cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Expression and phosphorylation of melanogeic protein were conducted using western blot. cAMP acceleration was measured by cAMP immunoassay kit. To investigate whitening mechanism, we used ERK inhibitor (PD98059). Results: DGC decreased intra cellular tyrosinase (TYR) activity and expression of melanin synthesis related proteins (TYR and TRP-1) in a dose-dependent manner on α-MSH induced melanogenesis. In addition, DGC induced the downregulation of MITF (melanocyte-specific transcription factor) through suppression of cAMP-CREB pathway. Also, phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) decreased MITF by DGC treatment. Conclusion: Therefore, DGC could be used as a whitening ingredient in skin and clinical usage against hyperpigmentation. © 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences","cyclicAMP; Dehydroglyasperin C; ERK; Melanogenesis; MITF","2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; alpha intermedin; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; dehydroglyasperin C; depigmenting agent; melanin; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; mitogen activated protein kinase; monophenol monooxygenase; protein synthesis inhibitor; tyrosinase related protein 1; unclassified drug; alpha intermedin; benzopyran derivative; Creb1 protein, mouse; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; dehydroglyasperin C; depigmenting agent; dopachrome isomerase; isomerase; melanin; membrane protein; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; Mitf protein, mouse; mitogen activated protein kinase; monophenol monooxygenase; oxidoreductase; Tyrp1 protein, mouse; 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; flavonoid; animal cell; Article; B16-F1 cell line; cAMP assay; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; melanogenesis; melanoma; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; protein expression level; protein synthesis inhibition; signal transduction; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; biosynthesis; drug effect; enzymology; experimental melanoma; melanocyte; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; skin pigmentation; tumor cell line; antagonists and inhibitors; cell survival; dose response; down regulation; enzyme activation; enzymology; experimental melanoma; metabolism; pathology; alpha-MSH; Animals; Benzopyrans; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Intramolecular Oxidoreductases; Melanins; Melanocytes; Melanoma, Experimental; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Oxidoreductases; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Skin Lightening Preparations; Skin Pigmentation; alpha-MSH; Cell Survival; Cyclic AMP; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Down-Regulation; Enzyme Activation; Flavonoids; Melanoma, Experimental",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051108236

To reduce the computational complexity of the SD algorithm for GSM, layer ordering and transmit antenna combination (TAC) partitioning are employed. The layer ordering scheme determines the detection order of layers based on their reliabilities, which are measured by their minimum mean-square errors (MMSEs). In TAC partitioning, which is combined with the early termination technique, the likely TACs are selected by exploiting an MMSE-based weighting metric to reduce the search space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ordering and partitioning aided SD schemes achieve nearly the same performance as the conventional SD scheme; however, they require significantly low complexity, especially in large GSM multiple-input-multiple-output systems and in the low SNR region. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Generalized spatial modulation (GSM); multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO); sphere decoding","Antennas; Communication channels (information theory); Computational complexity; Decoding; Feedback control; Global system for mobile communications; Mean square error; MIMO systems; Receivers (containers); Signal to noise ratio; Telecommunication repeaters; Detection ordering; Early termination; Minimum mean square errors; Multiple input multiple output system; Spatial modulations; Sphere decoding; Transmit antenna; Transmitting antenna; Modulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050616446

The effect of the microstructure on the yield strength and uniform elongation before and after strain aging was investigated. In the H-H steel fabricated at a high SCT and low FCT, the reduction in uniform elongation after prestraining was small, but the uniform elongation after heat treatment increased because of the presence of many mobile dislocations around AF and GB, which are present in a relatively high fraction. Because the H-L steel fabricated at high SCT and low FCT has a considerable amount of BF as a result of the significant degree of supercooling, carbon atoms were readily trapped at dislocations inside the BF during heat treatment, which reduced the resistance to strain aging. On the other hand, the L-L steel had a large amount of soft PF transformed in the two-phase (austenite + ferrite) region and high fractions of AF and MA because it was fabricated at low SCT and low FCT. As a result, the uniform elongation of the L-L steel was slightly increased after heat treatment because mobile dislocations were readily generated around the PF and MA boundaries under deformation. © 2018, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Austenite; Bainite; Cooling; Fabrication; Ferrite; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; Pipelines; Steel pipe; Yield stress; After-heat treatment; Cooling temperature; Degree of supercooling; Effect of the microstructures; Finish cooling temperatures; Mobile dislocations; Polygonal ferrites; Uniform elongation; Elongation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049114377

Among the various types of materials for RRAMs, such as oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and chalcogenides, AlN shows resistive switching phenomena with low energy and high speed via the formation of Al-rich conducting channels owing to the generation of nitrogen vacancies. Moreover, AlN has a large band gap (~ 6.2 eV), high thermal conductivity, and dielectric constant. Therefore, AlN can find application as a gate dielectric material, functional layer, and resistive switching layer for RRAM applications. In this study, AlN thin film is deposited by thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is a self-limiting technique through ligand exchange between the precursor molecules and surface functional groups.

To achieve elasticity, swelling ability, porous architecture and sufficient gel strength, hyaluronate was chemically modified by grafting and crosslinking methods using 2-HEA and PEGDA, respectively. The structure and compositions of the fabricated terpolymer (HA-g-p(2-HEA)-x-PEGDA) were verified by FTIR, 1H HR-MAS-NMR, and TGA analyses. The surface morphology and cross-section of the hydrogel was detected by SEM analysis. The gel nature of terpolymer in aqueous medium at 37 °C was confirmed from swelling study, and rheological experiment. Non-cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of the HA-g-p(2-HEA)-x-PEGDA hydrogel were ascertained by in vitro mouse osteoblastic cells (MC3T3) proliferation, and viability studies.

Although a conventional cascade boost converter has larger voltage gain compared to a boost converter, it is still not suitable for high step-up voltage conversion. In the proposed converter, a coupled inductor is adopted for the cascaded boost converter to further increase the voltage gain. However, a leakage inductance of the coupled inductor causes a high voltage spike at a main switch. A resistor-capacitor-diode snubber is commonly used to simply solve this problem, but it is also the cause of additional power loss. Therefore, the lossless passive snubber is suggested in this paper in order to prevent efficiency drop by a snubber circuit. In conclusion, the proposed converter has high voltage gain and improved power efficiency. Experimental results from an output 400-V 200-W prototype at a constant switching frequency of 50 kHz are presented to verify the performance of the proposed converter. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Boost converter; cascade converter; coupled inductor; high step-up converter; lossless passive snubber","Efficiency; Electric inductors; Electric inverters; Gain measurement; HVDC power transmission; BOOST converter; Cascade converters; Coupled inductor; High step-up converters; Passive snubbers; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041498821

Note, however, that these classifiers fail to detect adaptive spammers that dynamically change their spamming strategies or behaviors and attempt to pose as legitimate users. In this paper, we propose an efficient spammer detection system (which we call MTD-Spamguard) wherein the notion of MTD is applied to increase the robustness of well-known machine learning classifiers against the adaptive spammers in SNSs. The system introduces a new method of MTD wherein the concept of differential immunity of different classifiers is employed to detect the spammers. To classify a single user in the test dataset, we pick one of the appropriate trained classifiers from multiple classifiers and then use its classification output. To choose the appropriate classifier, we design an effective classifier switching strategy by formulating the interaction of users (normal users and spammers) and detector (which hosts the machine learning classifier) as a repeated Bayesian Stackelberg game. The classifier switching strategy provides strong Stackelberg equilibrium between users and detector, maximizing the accuracy of classification and reducing the misclassification of spammers. The system achieves 30% gain in classification accuracy over the Facebook dataset (constructed in our recent work). © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive spammer detection; Differential immunity; Machine learning; Moving target defense; Social networking service","Artificial intelligence; Hierarchical systems; Learning systems; Network security; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Accuracy of classifications; Bayesian stackelberg games; Classification accuracy; Differential immunity; Moving target defense; Social networking services; Spammer detections; Stackelberg equilibrium; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038088504

In the present study, we propose a novel support of nitrogen (N)-doped carbon and nickel (Ni) composites produced from protein using an impregnation process and carbonization to increase the electrical conductivity. To this end, we fabricated the Pt nanoparticles on N-doped carbon and Ni composites (Pt@NC/Ni). To obtain the optimized electrochemical performance, the amount of Ni components into carbon supports was controlled by three types. Specifically, as compared to commercial Pt/C and other samples, the optimized Pt@NC/Ni with the high electrical conductivity of 0.75 S cm−1 shows the lowest onset potential of 0.03 V, the highest anodic current density of 744 mA mgPt−1, and an excellent catalytic stability with the highest retention rate of 86%. Accordingly, this novel support provides multiple advantages in terms of the well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles on the surface, N-doping effect of carbon supports, and an increased electrical conductivity by the introduction of Ni components.

However, considering that the performances of the ECDs, including coloration efficiency (CE, &lt;30.0 cm 2 /C) and switching speed (&gt;10.0 s), are still low for an effective applied use, critical efforts are needed to push the development of a unique nanostructure film to improve electrochromic (EC) performances. Specifically, as the large-scale applications (e.g. refrigerators, vehicles, and airplanes) of the ECDs have been recently developed, the study for improving switching speed is urgently needed for commercialization of the devices. In this context, the present study reports a novel nanostructure film of Fe-doped WO 3 films with highly developed mesopores and oxygen vacancy defects, fabricated using the Fe agent and the camphene-assisted sol-gel method. Fe-doped WO 3 films with highly developed mesopores and oxygen vacancy defects show remarkable EC performances with both fast switching speed (2.8 s for the coloration speed and 0.3 s for the bleaching speed) and high CE (71.1 cm 2 /C). These two aspects contribute to the synergistic effects of optimized Fe doping and camphene on the films and have outstanding values as compared to previously reported results of WO 3 -based materials. Specifically, the fast switching speed is attributed to the shortened Li + diffusion pathway of the highly developed mesopores; and the other is the improved electrical conductivity of the highly increased oxygen vacancy defects. In addition, the high CE value is due to an efficient charge transport as the result of a more effective electroactive contact of the morphology with highly developed mesopores, resulting in a large transmittance modulation with a small intercalated charge density. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Camphene; Fast-switching electrochromic performances; Fe-doped WO 3; Mesoporous structures; Oxygen vacancy defects; Sol-gel method","Camphene; Defects; Electric fields; Electrochromic devices; Electrochromism; Films; Iron; Iron compounds; Nanostructures; Oxygen; Semiconductor doping; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Speed; Switching; Tungsten compounds; Coloration efficiencies; Electrical conductivity; Electrochromic performance; Fe-doped; Large-scale applications; Mesoporous structures; Optoelectronic applications; Oxygen vacancy defects; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047067156

If an emergency occurs, a rapid transition to islanding mode is executed to evaluate the cause of problem and to prevent further damage. However, seamless transition control is not realizable because of speed constraints introduced by the communication protocols being used today. This paper reviews the current technologies applied in a microgrid communication system and presents a new study to solve this problem using EtherCAT, a real-time Ethernet protocol. The advantages of this solution with respect to the state-of-the-art are summarized.

To do this, newly developed high-strength (fpu of 2400 MPa) prestressing (PS) strands were used. The initial and effective prestressing forces applied were 94% of the yield strength and 70% of the ultimate tensile strength of the strands. The difference between the transfer lengths at the cut end and dead end was reduced by increasing the section depth. Greater strains were found at the cut end due to a lateral expansion of the strands by the Hoyer effect compared with those at the dead end, causing a greater stress concentration. The eight most widely used prediction models were adopted to predict the transfer lengths of high-strength PS strands in full-scale PSC beams, and it was found that all models significantly overestimated the transfer lengths. Accordingly, the conservative use of the ACI recommendation of 50db is suggested based on this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Full-scale PSC beam; High-strength strand; Hoyer effect; Section depth; Transfer length","Highway bridges; Holmium compounds; Prestressed concrete; Prestressing; Tensile strength; Full-scale PSC beam; High strength; Hoyer effect; Section depth; Transfer lengths; Concrete beams and girders; bridge; concrete structure; railway; road; strength; stress field; structural component",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048156787

To select the critical segment, a multicriteria decision technique is applied by considering the hydraulic, social and economic effect.

Since he was illegally captured off the coast of Juju Island in May 2009, he had been performing in dolphin shows at Seoul Zoo, which is owned and operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The release demanded considerable public expenditure, of which the source was local taxes gathered from the residents of Seoul. This paper seeks to conduct an ex-post evaluation of the release, employing the contingent valuation (CV) technique. A total of 500 households living in Seoul in 2013 participated in the CV survey to report their willingness to pay (WTP) for the release. Fifty-two percent were willing to accept an increase in local taxes over the next five years to carry out the release. The mean household WTP estimate was obtained as KRW 4880 (USD 4.56) per annum. The present values of the total WTP and the cost of the release are KRW 79.82 billion (USD 74.53 million) and KRW 751 million (USD 701,000), respectively, in 2013. Interestingly, the former is much more than the latter.

Concrete track is also advantageous in terms of stability of travel, and it has the advantage of drastically reducing maintenance cost of railway; however, the earthwork railway subbase is vulnerable to settlement of the structure. Maintenance of concrete track becomes difficult in cases of settlement, because twisting or deformation occurs. The track irregularity is maintained based on data from track vehicle. However, the data does not represent actual track alignment. The quality index based on this data is also limited in highway railway track management, which requires high precision. In this paper, actual inspection data using level surveying and 3D electro optical distance meter surveying are analyzed with data of the track vehicle. In addition, a more reasonable approach is suggested from the maintenance point of the concrete track. © 2018 The Korean Society for Railway.

Medium-carbon steel specimens with different bainitic microstructures are fabricated by varying the isothermal conditions and their microstructures are characterized using OM, SEM and EBSD analysis. Hardness and Charpy impact tests are also performed to examine the correlation of microstructure and mechanical properties. The microstructural analysis results reveal that granular bainite, bainitic ferrite, lath martensite and retained austenite form differently in the specimens. The volume fraction of granular bainite and bainitic ferrite increases as the isothermal holding temperature increases, which decreases the hardness of specimens isothermally heat-treated at 300 °C or higher. The specimens isothermally heat-treated at 250 °C exhibit the highest hardness due to the formation of lath martensite, irrespective of isothermal holding time. The Charpy impact test results indicate that increasing isothermal holding time improves the impact toughness because of the increase in volume fraction of granular bainite and bainitic ferrite, which have a relatively soft microstructure compared to lath martensite for specimens isothermally heat-treated at 250 °C and 300 °C. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Bainitic steels; Isothermal heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Medium carbon; Microstructure","Bainite; Carbon steel; Ferrite; Hardness; Heat treatment; Isotherms; Martensite; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Steel metallography; Steel research; Volume fraction; Bainitic microstructures; Bainitic steel; Isothermal heat treatments; Isothermal holding temperature; Isothermal holding time; Medium carbon bainitic steel; Microstructural analysis; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Charpy impact testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056429855

The recent studies have focused on fabricating c-Si solar modules with low cost and improved efficiency. Among many suggested methods, a photovoltaic module with a shingled structure that is connected to a small cut cell in series is a recent strong candidate for low-cost, high efficiency energy harvesting systems. The shingled structure increases the efficiency compared to the module with 6 inch full cells by minimizing optical and electrical losses. In this study, we propoese a new Conductive Paste (CP) to interconnect cells in a shingled module and compare it with the Electrical Conductive Adhesives (ECA) in the conventional module. Since the CP consists of a compound of tin and bismuth, the module is more economical than the module with ECA, which contains silver. Moreover, the melting point of CP is below 150 °C, so the cells can be integrated with decreased thermal-mechanical stress. The output of the shingled PV module connected by CP is the same as that of the module with ECA. In addition, electroluminescence (EL) analysis indicates that the introduction of CP does not provoke additional cracks. Furthermore, the CP soldering connects cells without increasing ohmic losses. Thus, this study confirms that interconnection with CP can integrate cells with reduced cost in shingled c-Si PV modules. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Conductive paste; Crystalline silicon; Electrically conductive adhesives; Shingled cells interconnection; Soldering process","Adhesives; Bismuth alloys; Costs; Crystalline materials; Electroluminescence; Energy harvesting; Photovoltaic cells; Silver alloys; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Soldering; Ternary alloys; Tin alloys; Conductive pastes; Crystalline silicons; Electrically conductive adhesives; Shingled cells interconnection; Soldering process; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056410622

At a temperature of less than 350 °C, threedimensional structures consisting of cube-shaped Cu2O are formed, while spherical small particles of the CuO phase are formed at a temperature higher than 400 °C due to a Volmer-Weber growth mode on the silicon substrate. As a chelating agent was added to the source solutions, two-dimensional Cu2O thin films are preferentially deposited at a temperature less than 300 °C, and the CuO thin film is formed even at a temperature less than 350 °C.

The failure mechanism of fatigued Ag nanowire (AgNW) electrode and its effect on the electrical degradation was investigated. Instead of bending fatigue of previous research, electrical resistance was measured in-situ during folding and torsion fatigue tests up to 100,000 cycles in this study. The damage mechanism of the AgNW including welding of network junction, nanocracking, and fragmentation were revealed by microscopic observation of the fatigued or interrupted specimens. Under the high strain folding fatigue condition, electrical resistance was observed to decrease initially and then subsequently to keep increasing. This initial decrease is attributed to the junction welding phenomenon and the continuous increase is due to nanocracking or fragmentation. For torsion fatigued electrodes, electrical resistance increased with increasing torsional degree. The increase in resistance with torsional degree was correlated with number of fragments of AgNW. Under the functional failure criterion of 10% change in electrical resistance, feasibility for foldable and wearable applications of the AgNW electrode was considered. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Failure mechanism; Fatigue; Silver nanowire; Wearable","Bending tests; Electric resistance; Fatigue of materials; Fatigue testing; Nanowires; Torsional stress; Transparent electrodes; Wearable technology; Welding; Welding electrodes; Electrical degradation; Electrical resistances; Failure mechanism; Mechanical fatigue; Microscopic observations; Silver nanowires; Wearable; Wearable applications; Failure (mechanical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054875807

This town, a center for indigenous beliefs and a shelter for oppressed people, emblematizes the Korean people's bittersweet modern history and forgotten dreams. Park examines the lost history of the town through photographs, films, and documentaries that have been produced in modern Korea. He also enables these dissident visual memories to combine or collide with each other. Park's video at times evokes an aesthetic that reminds viewers of Korean minjung (common people) artists' paintings.

Fuel injection with a common rail injector is possible when controlling the magnitude of the hydraulic pressure acting on the nozzle needle. There are two types of solenoids and piezo-electric components to open and close the hydraulic passages acting on the nozzle needle. A solenoid-type injector is driven by controlling the current waveform supplied to the injector via a peak & hold approach. The solenoid-type injector driver can be implemented with a circuit that switches the driving power with one transistor which has a high current capacity. In contrast, a piezo-type injector is driven by the contraction and expansion of piezoelectric elements that open and close the hydraulic passages to control the movement of the nozzle needle. In order to control the contraction and expansion of the piezoelectric element in a piezo injector, charge and discharge control of the current supplied to the injector is required. For this purpose, a pair-switch circuit capable of charging and discharging the current supplied to the injector has been developed. The driving voltage of the piezo injector was in the range of 100 ~ 140V. High voltage and current switches were used for charging and discharging. Fuel injection at a high common rail pressure was possible with higher driving voltage supplied to the piezo injector. The control signal supplied to the MOSFET (IRF640N) is generated with the output pin or CCP pin of an 8-bit microcontroller PIC16F917. The common rail pressure was controlled by supplying square waves while varying the duty ratio of the control signal. The microcontroller's capture compares PWM (CCP) pins outputs the control signal. When the duty ratio of the PWM square wave supplied to the rail pressure controller is increased, the common rail pressure is decreased. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Charge and discharge current; Common rail pressure; Injector driving voltage; MOSFET; Piezo injector driver",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054768048

A Schottky diode is used as the bypass diode in c-Si PV modules due to its low operating voltage. In this work, we systematically investigated the origin of bypass diode faults in c-Si PV modules operated outdoors. The temperature of the inner junction box where the bypass diode is installed increases as the ambient temperature increases. Its temperature rises to over 70 °C on sunny days in summer. As the temperature of the junction box increases from 25 to 70 °C, the leakage current increases up to 35 times under a reverse voltage of 15 V. As a result of the high leakage current of the bypass diode at high temperature, melt down of the junction barrier between the metal and semiconductor has been observed in damaged diodes collected from abnormally functioning PV modules. Thus, it is believed that the constant leakage current applied to the junction caused the melting of the junction, thereby resulting in a failure of both the bypass diode and the c-Si PV module. © 2018 MDPI AG.

This study aims to measure concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane, which account for the largest percentage of carbon emissions, to temporally estimate the carbon emitted during the pig-manure composting process. The research subject was a farmhouse raising 3000 growing pigs and 100 mother pigs. The capacity of the composting facility for pig manure treatment was 330 m2, and the daily treatment was about 6 tons. After the pig manure discharged from the pig farm was delivered to the composting facility, for the 8 days including 6 before mixing and 2 after mixing, the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 were measured. The result shows that the CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the composting facility were 1208 ± 385 ppm and 95 ± 10 ppm, respectively. In the comparison of concentrations before and after mixing at the composting facility, the values of both CO2 and CH4 increased, and the temperature increased as well. The concentration of CO2 and CH4 increased to 499 ± 103 ppm and 3 ± 11 ppm, respectively, and the temperature rose by 3.7 ± 1.0 °C and 1.6 ± 2.4 °C, respectively. In the correlation analysis (r = 0, p &lt; 0.05), the carbon dioxide emission in the composting process was 15.564 ± 3.671 tons C/year, whereas carbon emission was 1.379 ± 0.147 tons C/year. The concentrations of CO2 and methane, which are the current major atmospheric pollution sources, were respectively analyzed during the pig-manure composting process in this study to understand their effects. Thus, this paper attempts to elucidate the carbon cycle by measuring and analyzing the carbon data obtained from livestock excretions to secure a supply chain based on the intelligent use of the data. © 2018 by the authors.","Agriculture 4.0; Carbon emission; CH4; CO2; Composting process; Pig production industry; Real-time monitoring system; Swine farm; Swine manure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053858059

When heavy quarks are involved in a jet, the quark mass can lead to a numerically significant correction to the jet cross section and its substructure. With this motivation, we calculated the heavy quark mass effects to next-to-leading order in αs on the fragmentation functions to a jet (FFJs) and the jet fragmentation functions (JFFs), where the former describes fragmentation of parton into a jet and the latter describes fragmenting processes inside a jet. The finite size of the heavy quark mass does not change the ultraviolet behaviors, but it can give significant corrections to the finite contributions. When we take the zero mass limit, we find that the FFJs and the JFFs reproduce established results for massless partons. If we define the heavy quark jet as one that include at least one heavy (anti-)quark, the tagged heavy quark jet production is sensitive to the heavy quark mass and produces large logarithms of the mass. Taking advantage of the FFJs and JFFs, we formulate a factorization theorem for heavy quark jet production in order to resum these large logarithms systematically. As an application, we study inclusive b-jet production and show phenomenological implications due to keeping a non-zero quark mass. © 2018, The Author(s).","Perturbative QCD; Resummation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053560081

ASD is highly prevalent in Asia, Europe, and the United States, and the frequency of ASD is growing each year. Recent epidemiological studies have indicated that ASD may be caused or triggered by exposure to chemicals in the environment, such as those in the air or water. Thus, toxicological studies are needed to examine chemicals that might be implicated. However, the experimental efficiency of existing experimental models is limited, and many models represent challenges in terms of animal welfare. Thus, alternative ASD animal models are necessary. To address this, we examined the efficacy of the zebrafish embryo/larva as an alternative model of ASD. Specifically, we exposed zebrafish to valproic acid (0, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 μM), which is a chemical known to induce autism-like effects. We then analysed subsequent developmental, behavioural, and transcriptomic changes. We found that 100 μM and 50 μM valproic acid decreased the hatching rate and locomotor activity of zebrafish embryos/larvae. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in a number of genes associated with autism, such as adsl, mbd5, shank3, and tsc1b. Additionally, we found changes in gene ontology that were also reported in previous studies. Our findings indicate that zebrafish embryos/larvae and humans with ASD might have common physiological pathways, indicating that this animal model may represent an alternative tool for examining the causes of and potential treatments for this illness. © 2018 Lee et al.

At pH 3, β-carotene in emulsions having a thinner interfacial membrane formed with emulsifiers having less oxyethylene groups [0.050 day−1 of degradation rate constant (k)] slowly decompose, compared with ones stabilized with emulsifiers containing more oxyethylene groups (0.068 day−1 of k). At pH 3, iron molecules promote the degradation of β-carotene. Ferrous iron-mediated β-carotene degradation is faster in emulsions with a thicker interfacial membrane (0.113 and 0.165 day−1 of k for emulsions stabilized with emulsifiers having the smallest and largest number of oxyethylene groups). Interfacial denseness is not an important determinant in β-carotene degradation (p &gt; 0.05) when emulsions are stabilized by emulsifiers having the similar number of oxyethylene groups. Conclusively, the interfacial denseness and thickness of emulsions are important factors for inhibiting β-carotene degradation in emulsions. Practical Applications: β-carotene stability in emulsions is greatly influenced by their interfacial characteristics, depending on what is responsible for the β-carotene degradation. Therefore, when designing the emulsion-formed delivery systems it would be important to engineer the interfacial membrane of emulsion droplets to improve β-carotene stability therein. Interfacial thickness which is attributed by the hydrophilic group size (or length) of emulsifiers used is an important determinant in the chemical stability of β-carotene encapsulated into emulsions but sometimes it is not. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study aims to construct a novel deformable liposome using polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose distearate as an edge activator and a hydrogel containing hyaluronic acid (HA) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), as well as to investigate the synergistic effect of this system on the delivery of a cysteine derivative, methyl-2-acetylamino-3-(4-hydroxyl-3,5-dimethoxybenzoylthio)propanoate (MP) as a whitening agent. The optimized deformable liposome (DL2) contains 10% edge activator and has a particle size of 78.2 ± 2.7 nm, a zeta potential of −29.9 ± 1.8 mV, a polydispersity index of 0.248, and an entrapment efficiency of 90.7 ± 1.7%. MP-loaded DL2 has higher stability and deformability than DL2 without MP, as well as exerting a higher whitening effect than that observe with MP alone. In addition, MP-loaded DL2 is incorporated into a hydrogel in a dual drug-delivery system and the stability after hydrogel incorporation is evaluated. In Franz cells, the MP-loaded deformable liposome-hydrogel complex shows the highest skin permeation and penetration of MP. Practical Applications: In general, it is very difficult for whitening agents to penetrate a skin layer for reducing skin pigmentation. It is important to transfer whitening agents to the basal layer without causing physical damage to the skin. Deformable liposomes containing 10% polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose distearate in a hydrogel complex maximize the skin permeation of a cysteine derivative as a whitening agent. This finding indicates that the deformable liposome-hydrogel complex is a potential delivery system for treatment of skin hyperpigmentation. The penetration mechanism of drugs in the skin by deformable liposome-hydrogel complexes is as follows: Hydrogel hydrates stratum corneum to secure the route of drugs or nanocarrier permeation. polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose distearate as an edge activator enhances the fluidity of the stratum corneum lipid layer and the deformability of liposome. The edge activator-based deformable liposomes pass through the stratum corneum stably. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In particular, transient instability in a power system needs to be immediately addressed, and preventive measures should be in place prior to fault occurrence. Measures to achieve transient stability include system reinforcement, power generation restriction, and generator tripping. Because the interpretation of transient stability is a time domain simulation, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of proposed countermeasures using only simple simulation results. Therefore, several methods to quantify transient stability have been introduced. Among them, the single machine equivalent (SIME) method based on the equal area criterion (EAC) can quantify the degree of instability by calculating the residual acceleration energy of a generator. However, method for generator tripping effect evaluation does not have been established. In this study, we propose a method to evaluate the effect of generator tripping on transient stability that is based on the SIME method. For this purpose, the measures that reflect generator tripping in the SIME calculation are reviewed. Simulation results obtained by applying the proposed method to the IEEE 39-bus system and KEPCO system are then presented. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","Generator tripping; Power system stability; SIME method; Transient stability assessment; Transient stability margin","Electric power system measurement; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; System stability; Time domain analysis; Generator-tripping; Power system stability; SIME method; Transient stability assessment; Transient stability margins; Transients",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052147172

However, brittle films, such as transparent conducting oxide electrodes and permeation barrier films, are still needed to maintain the high performance and reliability of flexible devices. In this study, we established a fracture mechanics model of brittle films on a polymer substrate under bending conditions. Using numerical simulation, we investigated the effects of a buffer layer between the brittle film and substrate on the fracture performance when the channel crack was formed in the brittle film. The mechanics model indicated that the Young's modulus and thickness of the buffer layer were the important parameters determining the crack resistance of the film. The buffer layer with higher stiffness than the substrate enhanced the crack resistance of the brittle film as the thickness of the buffer layer increased. In contrast, the buffer layer with lower stiffness than the substrate reduced the crack resistance of the brittle film. In this case, the increase in the thickness of the buffer layer further decreased the fracture performance of the brittle film. The present study is expected to provide practical design guidance to enhance the bending durability of the brittle films and multilayer barrier films on polymer substrates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Buffer layers; Conductive films; Elastic moduli; Fracture mechanics; Multilayer films; Multilayers; Polymer films; Stiffness; Substrates; Transparent conducting oxides; Transparent electrodes; Flexible electronic devices; Fracture mechanics model; Fracture performance; Multilayer barrier films; Multilayer structures; Performance and reliabilities; Permeation barriers; Transparent conducting oxide electrodes; Cracks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051408783

The multi-site calibration was defined by a multi-objective optimization problem for which individual objective functions were used to measure errors at each site. In the hydrodynamic model, coefficients of power functions that show the changing relationships between Manning’s roughness and discharge in each sub-reach were optimized by minimizing the residuals of multiple sites. Different combinations of weights were assigned to sites in the application of an aggregation approach to solve the multi-objective function, and the corresponding Pareto optimal parameter sets were assumed as the ROPS candidates. All performance measures to individual Pareto optimal parameter sets were calculated and the ROPS was determined using MRA. The set which has the lowest maximum regret obtained by averaging the results from calibration and validation was determined as the only ROPS. It was found that the estimated variable roughness and the corresponding computed water levels varied considerably depending on the weights assigned to sites. Using the proposed method, the task to assign proper weights on multiple sites can be easily achieved for multi-site calibration problems. This study provides a multi-criteria decision making method to choose a ROPS that has the lowest potential regret among various alternatives for hydrologic and hydraulic models. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Hydrodynamic model; Minimax regret approach; Multi-site calibration; Pareto optimal parameter sets; Robust parameter set (ROPS); Variable roughness","Calibration; Decision making; Hydraulic models; Hydrodynamics; Pareto principle; Site selection; Water levels; Hydrodynamic model; Minimax regret; Multi-site calibration; Pareto-optimal; Robust parameters; Multiobjective optimization; calibration; flow modeling; hydrodynamics; optimization; parameterization; water level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049770544

Recent developments in computational thermodynamics and related application software have made it possible to design a suitable material as well as support engineers of steel manufacturing companies in the production of the designed material with minimum benchmarks in practical operations. This paper reports our recent success in developing grade 600 MPa reinforced steel bars for seismic safety in South Korea. First, conventional alloy design based on CALPHAD-type computational thermodynamics was carried out. For this purpose, a typical alloy system of Fe-0.30C-0.23Si-1.37Mn-0.14V-0.22Cu (in wt%) was selected, and thermodynamic and kinetic calculations were carried out using MatCalc and JMatPro software. Second, in order to reduce V content in the steel for economic reasons, a cooling process designed using finite element (FE) simulation based on the thermodynamic database was performed. For this application, Fe-0.34C-0.22Si-1.34Mn-0.04 V (in wt%) alloy was chosen, and the FE software ABAQUS was applied for modeling the TempCore process. The mechanical properties of the steel products with a diameter of 32 mm produced based on the simulated results satisfy the required properties for grade 600 MPa seismic reinforced steel bars. © 2018","Calphad; Reinforced steel bar; Seismic safety","ABAQUS; Application programs; Bars (metal); Benchmarking; Global warming; Reinforcement; Seismic design; Seismology; Thermodynamics; Calphad; Computational thermodynamics; Computer-aided alloy design; Finite element simulations; Kinetic calculations; Reinforced steel; Seismic safety; Thermodynamic database; C (programming language)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047724246

Smart cities are based on autonomous and distributed infrastructure that includes intelligent information processing and control systems heterogeneous network infrastructure, and ubiquitous sensing involving millions of information sources Due to the continued growth of data volume and number of connected IoT devices, however, issues such as high latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, security and privacy, and scalability arise in the current smart city network architecture. Designing an efficient, secure, and scalable distributed architecture by bringing computational and storage resources closer to endpoints is needed to address the limitations of today's smart city network. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid network architecture for the smart city by leveraging the strength of emerging Software Defined Networking and blockchain technologies. To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, our architecture is divided into two parts: core network and edge network. Through the design of a hybrid architecture, our proposed architecture inherits the strength of both centralized and distributed network architectures. We also propose a Proof-of-Work scheme in our model to ensure security and privacy. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of our proposed model, we simulate our model and evaluate it based on various performance metrics.

In this work, ZTO films were grown by atomic layer deposition and were logically characterized with the aim of understanding the correlations between compositional changes and film properties. The ZnO:SnO2 pulse ratio significantly affected the growth rate, crystal structure, morphology, and band gap of the ZTO films. By controlling the Sn/(Sn + Zn) atomic ratio, the optical band gap of the ZTO films was tuned between 3.05 and 3.36 eV. Integrating the ZTO films as buffer layers in CIGS solar cells, we observed that films with Sn concentrations of 9 to 16 at.% yielded photo-conversion efficiency close to 14%, which was very comparable to efficiency attained with the commonly used CdS buffer. Furthermore, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, we correlated the current-voltage behavior of the cells to the conduction band offset at the ZTO/ CIGS interface.

A wealth of data supports the hypothesis that hIAPP's toxicity is related to an abnormal interaction of amyloids with islet cell membranes. Thus, many studies aimed at finding effective therapies for T2DM focus on the design of molecules that are able to inhibit hIAPP's amyloid growth and the related membrane damage as well. Based on this view and inspired by its known anti-amyloid properties, we have functionalized resveratrol with a phosphoryl moiety (4′-O-PR) that improves its solubility and pharmacological properties. A second resveratrol derivative has also been obtained by conjugating resveratrol with a dimyristoylphosphatidyl moiety (4′-DMPR). The use of both compounds resulted in abolishing both amyloid growth and amyloid mediated POPC/POPS membrane damage in tube tests. We propose that a mixture of a water-soluble anti-aggregating compound and its lipid-anchored derivative may be employed as a general strategy to prevent and/or to halt amyloid–related membrane damage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregation; Cytoxicity; Natural compounds; Oxydative stress; Protection","4' o (1,2 di o myristoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoryl)resveratrol; 4' o phosphorylresveratrol; amylin; amyloid; resveratrol; unclassified drug; Article; conjugation; controlled study; drug solubility; membrane damage; oxidative stress; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044576789

However, chronic administration of insulin often develops local amyloidosis at the injection site, pathologically known as “Insulin Ball”. This reduces the insulin bioavailability and exacerbates the disease pathology. Thus, the molecular interaction between insulin and the recipient's membrane surface plays a co-operative role in accelerating the amyloidosis. This interaction, however, is different from the molecular interaction of insulin with the native membranous environment of the pancreatic β-cells. The differential membrane mediated interaction that directly affects the aggregation kinetics of insulin remains elusive yet intriguing to understand the mechanism of pathological development. In this study we have characterized the interactions of insulin at different states with model eukaryotic membranes using high and low-resolution spectroscopic techniques in combination with microscopic investigation. Our results show that insulin amyloid intermediates are capable of interacting with model membranes with variable functional affinity towards the different compositions. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy confirms the aggregation states of insulin in presence of the eukaryotic model membranes while solid-state NMR spectroscopy in conjugation with differential scanning calorimetry elucidates the molecular interaction of insulin intermediates with the lipid head groups along with the acyl chains. Additionally, dye leakage assays support the eukaryotic model membrane disruption by insulin intermediates, similar to hIAPP and Aβ40, as previously reported. Thus, the present study establishes the distinct mode of interactions of insulin amyloid with pancreatic β-cell and general mammalian cell mimicking membranes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AFM; DSC; FCS; Insulin amyloid; Membrane; ssNMR; TEM","insulin; phosphorus 31; amyloidosis; Article; biological model; cell membrane; controlled study; differential scanning calorimetry; eukaryote; fluorescence analysis; hormone structure; insulin fibrillation; mammal cell; membrane damage; molecular interaction; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; solid state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041910623

MNBs contain gas cores due to which they are echogenic and can be used as contrast agents for ultrasonic and photoacoustic imaging. These bubbles can be engineered in various sizes as vehicles for gas and drug delivery applications with novel properties and flexible structures. Hypoxic areas in tumors develop owing to an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand. In tumors, hypoxic regions have shown more resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapies. The efficacy of photodynamic therapy depends on the effective accumulation of photosensitizer drug in tumors and the availability of oxygen in the tumor to generate reactive oxygen species. MNBs have been shown to reverse hypoxic conditions, degradation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α protein, and increase tissue oxygen levels. This review summarizes the synthesis methods and shell compositions of micro/nanobubbles and methods deployed for oxygen delivery.

The effects of the mediators on Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) performances are investigated when yeast and glucose are the biocatalyst and the substrate, respectively. Yeast tends to stand as floating cell rather than attached to supporting electrode. Therefore, to combine direct and mediated electron transfer mechanisms of yeast, two mediators and carbon felt modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI) (CF-PEI) are adopted and their roles are evaluated. As a result, CF-PEI surface is functionalized with amino groups that can attract and entrap more yeast cells. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves representing the mechanisms demonstrate that electron transfer rate constant of MB (0.44 s−1) is higher than MR (0.37 s−1). In addition, the performances of the yeast-MFC adopting MB (429.29 ± 42.75 mW m-2 at ∼1200 mA m−2) are better than those of the yeast-MFC adopting MR and the yeast-MFC without mediator.

The SiNx film was fabricated by roll-to-roll, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (R2R-PECVD) in widths as large as 500 mm. The effects of the NH3/SiH4 flow ratio on the SiNx properties were investigated according to their refractive index, optical characteristics, film density, WVTR, and chemical composition. The durability of the flexibility of the SiNx film was investigated via outer/inner bending test and cyclic bending fatigue test. The SiNx film showed excellent thickness uniformity and optical properties. At the NH3/SiH4 flow ratio of 3, the SiNx film exhibited the highest film density and the best moisture barrier performances of 1.67 × 10−3 g/m2·day. The results of the inner bending test showed that the flexibility of the SiNx film was excellent. The test results showed that the failure bending radius was 2 mm. The durable flexibility of the SiNx film was influenced by the internal residual stress and microstructure. After 10,000 cyclic inner-bending fatigue tests, no crack was observed, and the WVTR values were maintained below 2.0 × 10−3 g/m2·day. These results indicate that the single-layer SiNx film fabricated with a simple R2R PECVD has a high potential as a moisture barrier film for future flexible electronic applications. © 2018","Flexible durability; Moisture barrier film; Roll-to-roll plasma deposition; Silicon nitride film; Water vapor transmission rate","Bending tests; Durability; Fatigue testing; Moisture; Nitrides; Plasma CVD; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Refractive index; Silicon nitride; Water vapor; Bending fatigue tests; Chemical compositions; Electronic application; Moisture barriers; Optical characteristics; Roll to Roll; Silicon Nitride Film; Water vapor transmission rate; Optical films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048206196

PBI membranes are chemically stable and effectively block vanadium cations, but have a lower conductivity than Nafion. Here we describe the fabrication of layered membranes, which consist of a 40 µm thick porous Nafion layer and a 2–17 µm thin PBI blocking layer. To promote adhesion, a &lt;2 µm thick layer of a 1:1 Nafion/PBI blend is introduced between the outer layers. While this bonding layer is necessary to promote adhesion, the strong ionic interactions between Nafion and PBI reduce the acid uptake. Immersed in 1 M sulfuric acid (SA), the weight of meta-PBI increases 17%, while that of NP1:3, NP1:1 and NP3:1 only increases 16%, 8% and 7%, respectively. This decreases the conductivity in 2 M SA from 2.8 mS cm −1 for meta-PBI to 1.5, 0.4 and 0.04 mS cm −1 for NP1:3, NP1:1 and NP3:1, respectively.

This approach was used to analyze the characteristics of droughts for the current (1976-2005) and the future (2010-2099) climates. The future climate data obtained from 28 general circulation models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) was divided into three general periods: Future 1: 2010-2039, Future 2: 2040-2069; and Future 3: 2070-2099. As a result, aggregation R-R-V representing water availability would increase during Future 1, and then gradually decrease until the end of the century. The frequencies of future drought events for Future 2 and Future 3 were similar to the current frequency, while the durations will be longer and the severity will be higher at most locations during Future 3. Thus, the mean of R-R-V over South Korea is expected to decrease, except for Future 1, and the spatial variability of R-R-V is expected to increase. In the end, the changes in the mean and variance of rainfall and temperature would lead to a decrease in the mean and increase in the spatial variation of sustainability in South Korea. This approach and its results can be used to establish a long-term drought strategy for regions where the risk of future drought is expected to increase. © 2018 by the author.","Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5); Drought analysis; Reliability-Resiliency-Vulnerability (R-R-V) approach; Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)","CMIP; drought; estimation method; evapotranspiration; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); reliability analysis; resilience; spatial variation; sustainability; vulnerability; water availability; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052512660

In the antenna level, those MC effects can be represented in terms of two main MIMO antenna parameters: The antenna correlation and radiation efficiency. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of MC-related effects only on the antenna parameters, which then can be plugged into multiplexing efficiency, a realistic antenna-level MIMO performance metric, to evaluate the trade-off between two opposite MC effects. Uniform linear arrays with and without polarization diversity are used to analyze the MC effects, and to clarify the ambiguities of their contributions on the MIMO performance. The impacts of azimuth and elevation angular spreads to the MC and MIMO antenna performance are also investigated. Results show that the MC, contrary to common intuition, has a positive contribution to the MIMO performance relative to when MC is not considered in the system, especially at small antenna spacing. It implies that the correlation reduction dominates the gain loss from the MC effects. So, we can infer that the MC actually is not the reason for performance degradation in small spacing antenna arrays. © 2013 IEEE.","3-D channel model; MIMO antenna parameters; MIMO antenna performance; multiplexing efficiency (ME); mutual coupling (MC); polarization diversity","Antenna arrays; Communication channels (information theory); Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Polarization; Channel model; MIMO antenna; Mutual coupling; Mutual coupling effects; Performance degradation; Polarization diversity; Spatial channel models; Threedimensional (3-d); Radiation effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052701991

The challenges of achieving an efficient integration, especially the integration of a cycle-accurate simulator into an event-driven environment, are addressed.

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the alkyl chain number of sucrose surfactants as an edge activator in elastic nanoliposomes. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the elastic nanoliposomes were characterized and an in vitro human skin permeation study was performed. Elastic nanoliposomes that were composed of sucrose monostearate (MELQ), sucrose distearate (DELQ), and sucrose tristearte (TELQ) were prepared using a thin-film hydration method. Particle size and entrapment efficiency of elastic nanoliposomes increased proportionally with an increase in the amounts and the numbers of the stearate in sucrose surfactant. Deformability of elastic nanoliposomes was indicated as DELQ > MELQ > TELQ and the same pattern was revealed through the in vitro human skin permeability tests. These results suggest that the number of alkyl chains of sucrose surfactant as edge activator affects the physicochemical property, stability, and skin permeability in elastic nanoliposome.

The need for microRNA (miRNA)-sensing platforms is particularly urgent because miRNAs are key regulators and biomarkers in numerous pathological processes and diseases. Unfortunately, however, development of such miRNA-sensing platforms has not yet been achieved. In order to realize the detection of these important biomarkers, there has been an increasing demand for POC-sensing platforms that enable label-free quantification with low sample consumption, good sensitivity, real-time responsiveness, and high throughput. Here, we developed a highly specific, sensitive LSPR miRNA-sensing platform on a flexible, scalable plasmonic nanostructure to enable single-base mismatch discrimination and attomole detection of miRNAs in clinically relevant samples. The hairpin probe contained a locked nucleic acid (LNA) that enabled the discrimination of single base mismatches based on differences in melting temperatures of perfectly matched or single base mismatched miRNAs when they formed base pairs with probes. In addition, through hybridization induced signal amplification based on precipitate formation on the gold surface through the enzyme reaction, we observed a dramatic LSPR peak shift, which enabled attomole detection. Additionally, our LSPR miRNA sensor enabled the detection of miR-200a-3p in total RNA extracts from primary cancer cell lines without purification or labeling of the miRNA. This label-free and highly specific miRNA sensing platform may have applications in POC cancer diagnostics without the need for gene amplification. © 2018 The Authors","LSPR biosensor; miRNA sensing; Scalable plasmonic nanostructure; Single base mismatch discrimination","Biomarkers; Biosensors; Cell culture; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gene expression; Nanostructures; Nucleic acids; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Probes; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface reactions; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Locked nucleic acid; miRNA sensing; Pathological process; Plasmonic nanostructures; Single nucleotides; Single-base mismatch; Three-dimensional nanostructures; RNA; locked nucleic acid; microRNA; microRNA 200a 3p; nanomaterial; unclassified drug; microRNA; nanomaterial; Article; base mispairing; base pairing; branched DNA signal amplification assay; cancer cell line; cancer diagnosis; DNA hairpin; enzyme mechanism; gene amplification; human; human cell; melting temperature; point of care testing; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; RNA purification; single nucleotide polymorphism; surface plasmon resonance; three dimensional imaging; chemistry; devices; equipment design; genetics; lab on a chip; neoplasm; procedures; surface plasmon resonance; tumor cell culture; tumor cell line; Base Pair Mismatch; Cell Line, Tumor; Equipment Design; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; MicroRNAs; Nanostructures; Neoplasms; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046171558

Currently used retaining wall methods include the common strut method, anchor method, slurry wall method, and raker method. However, these methods have drawbacks such as reduced workspace and intrusion into private property, and thus, efforts are being made to improve them. The most advanced retaining wall method is the prestressed wale system, so far, in which a load corresponding to the earth pressure is applied to the wale by using the tension of a prestressed (PS) strand wire. This system affords advantages such as providing sufficient workspace by lengthening the strut interval and minimizing intrusion into private properties adjacent to the site. However, this system cannot control the tension of the PS strand wire, and thus, it cannot actively cope with changes in the earth pressure due to excavation. This study conducts a preliminary numerical analysis of the field applicability of the controllable prestressed wale system (CPWS) which can adjust the tension of the PS strand wire. For the analysis, back analysis was conducted through two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical analyses based on the field measurement data of the typical strut method, and then, the field applicability of CPWS was examined by comparing the lateral deflection of the wall and adjacent ground surface settlements under the same conditions. In addition, the displacement and settlement of the wall were predicted through numerical analysis while the prestress force of CPWS was varied, and the structural stability was analysed through load tests on model specimens. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.","Controllable prestressed wale system (CPWS); Finite element analysis; Indoor model test; Retaining wall methods","Excavation; Finite element method; Numerical analysis; Pressure distribution; Retaining walls; Stability; Struts; Wire; Construction period; Field measurement data; Ground surface settlements; Model tests; Pre-stressed; Structural stabilities; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Numerical methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051727716

With the increasing demand of FOWLP technology, heterogeneous or multilayer FOWLP technology becomes the great subject of interest. However, many challenges such as warpage, mechanical stress, thermal stability, die shift, topography, fine-pitch RDL (redistribution layer), and low k dielectric are still present. Also, FOWLP with multilayer RDLs is required for high performance and high density IC devices, and these challenges become more severe with organic based interlayer dielectrics. To help mechanical, thermal, and chemical stabilities an insertion of inorganic based spin-on-dielectric (SOD) into a multilayer FOWLP structure is investigated.

An oxidized silicon wafer was used for the substrate, and an oxide layer was used on the active side of the die. Die warpage was controlled by applying UBM layers on the die backside. The thickness of the copper in the UBM layers was varied to 3 μm, 5 μm, and 7 μm. Two types of polyimide (PI) layers between the UBM layers formed and reduced die warpage, which was measured by the shadow moiré measurement method. Also, the thickness of the electro-plated copper in the UBM layers and the PI layers before the UBM layers affected the degree of die warpage during reflow. When forming the PI layer on the die before the UBM, the degree of die warpage was decreased compared to that without the PI layer in the cooling temperature range of the reflow profile. The silicon dies exhibited no warpage near the solder solidification temperature. This structure and process using a backside UBM layer and molten solder in the flip-chip bonding not only improved die shifts, but controlled die warpage during die pick -and-placement processes for fan-out packaging applications and also controlled die warpage during the die pick -and-placement step and in stack-via height formation process applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Backsided under bump metallurgy; Die Warpage control; Fan-out package","Chip scale packages; Copper; Flip chip devices; Metallurgy; Network components; Silicon oxides; Silicon wafers; Backside metallization; Fan Out; Oxidized silicon wafers; Packaging applications; Process applications; Solidification temperature; Under-bump metallurgies; Warpage control; Dies",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051932882

In this study, the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of DCQA isomers on melanogenesis in B16F1 murine melanoma cells stimulated by melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) was evaluated. DCQA isomers showed inhibitory effects on melanogenesis in α-MSH-stimulated B16F1 cells. Furthermore, the anti-melanogenesis activities of 1,5-DCQA and 4,5-DCQA were 61% and 84%, respectively, which were greater than that of arbutin (35%). For cell-free tyrosinase, 3,4-DCQA and 4,5-DCQA indicated high inhibitory effects, similar to the activity to arbutin (35%) at 25 μM. DCQA isomers inhibited the melanogenic enzymes including tyrosinase and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) on α-MSH-stimulated B16F1 cells. Interestingly, 4,5-DCQA, the most potent inhibitor of melanogenesis among the six DCQA isomers, significantly downregulated the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1) containing tyrosinase, and DCT. In particular, the inhibitory mechanism of 4,5-DCQA on MITF expression was elucidated, revealing that 4,5-DCQA inhibits the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) by attenuating cAMP generation during melanogenesis. A molecular docking study was conducted to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of 4,5-DCQA on cAMP production. DCQA isomers dock to the residues of adenylyl cyclase with a distance of <3 Å, except for 1,3-DCQA. Especially, 4,5-DCQA showed Full Fitness of −1304.68 kcal/mol and △G of −8.33 kcal/mol, as well as H-bonding with adenylyl cyclase at ILE953 and LYS930 residues. In conclusion, DCQA isomers have different effects on melanogenesis depending on their structure. Especially, 4,5-DCQA has depigmentation activity through the inhibitory effect on cellular tyrosinase directly and binding effect on adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the downregulation of MITF protein, thereby reducing the expression of melanogenic enzymes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adenylyl cyclase; Dicaffeoylquinic acid; Epigementation; Molecular docking analysis; Tyrosinase","1,4 dicaffeoylquinic acid; 3,4 dicaffeoylquinic acid; 3,5 dicaffeoylquinic acid; 4,5 dicaffeoylquinic acid; adenylate cyclase; alpha intermedin; antioxidant; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; cynarine; dopachrome tautomerase; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; quinic acid; tyrosinase related protein 1; unclassified drug; caffeoylquinic acid; enzyme inhibitor; melanin; monophenol monooxygenase; quinic acid; antioxidant activity; Article; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; drug mechanism; drug receptor binding; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme synthesis; human; human cell; hydrogen bond; melanogenesis; molecular model; MTT assay; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug effect; melanocyte; metabolism; molecular docking; mouse; stereoisomerism; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell culture; Animals; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Melanins; Melanocytes; Mice; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Structure; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Quinic Acid; Stereoisomerism; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049984070

To investigate cellular protective effects on the HaCaT cell, the intracellular ROS scavenging activity was measured after UVB irradiation and the ethyl acetate fraction of H. cordata showed the activity in a concentration-dependent from 1.6 µg/mL and a reduction rate of 54.3% at a maximum concentration of 12.5 µg/mL. Also, HaCaT cell protective effect against H decreased the cell viability of the ethyl acetate fraction of H. cordata which significantly increased the cell viability 2 O 2 -mediatedfrom 0.8 µg/mL and the maximum cell viability showed 86.9%. The ethyl acetate fraction of the H. cordata extracts was analyzed by TLC and HPLC. As a result, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, rutin and afzelin were identified. From the above results, it was suggested that the extracts and fractions of H. cordata have a potential to be applied in the field of cosmetics as a natural antioxidant/preservative capable of protecting the cell membrane from the oxidative stress by eliminating ROS and exhibiting the antimicrobial effect. © 2018, Korean Society of Industrial Engineering Chemistry.

Although the as-received specimens of all the steels exhibit a tempered martensite structure with lath type morphology, the A steel, which has the smallest carbon content, had the lowest hardness due to reduced solid solution hardening and larger lath thickness, irrespective of tempering conditions. As the tempering temperature increases, the hardness of the steels steadily decreases because dislocation density decreases and the lath thickness of martensite increases due to recovery and over-aging effects. When the variations in hardness plotted as a function of tempering temperature are compared with the hardness of the as-received specimens, it seems that the B steel, which has the highest yield and tensile strengths, is fabricated by quenching, while the other steels are fabricated by quenching and tempering. On the other hand, the impact properties of the steels are affected by specimen orientation and test temperature as well as microstructure. Based on these results, the effect of tempering on the microstructure and mechanical properties of commercial high-hardness armor steels is discussed. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","High-hardness armor; Impact toughness; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Steels","Armor; Fracture toughness; Hardness; Martensite; Microstructure; Quenching; Steel; Tempering; Tensile strength; Toughness; Dislocation densities; High hardness; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Quenching and tempering; Solid solution hardening; Tempering conditions; Tempering temperature; Yield and tensile strength; Mechanical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055694567

However, the approach is not feasible over inaccessible areas where control points cannot be easily acquired. For the case, a relative orientation can be utilized only with conjugate points, but its accuracy for satellite sensor should be studied because the sensor has different geometry compared to well-known frame type cameras. Therefore, we carried out the bias-compensation of RPCs (Rational Polynomial Coefficients) without any ground control points to study its precision and effects on the y-parallax in epipolar resampled images. The conjugate points were generated with stereo image matching with outlier removals. RPCs compensation was performed based on the affine and polynomial models.

In 2016, upon the Republic of Korea's 70th anniversary of liberation, its government decided to have all governmental agencies use a new government symbol, ""Tae-geuk."" However, issues arose since each government agency used the symbol in a different way or perverted it. Therefore, this research sought to find a way to address the problems centered around the government symbol and suggest improvements. Methods An investigation of application through an on-the-spot, Web/Mobile, and internet investigation was executed for 960 government institutions that had applied the government symbol. Materials from the investigation of application were analyzed, problems were identified, and an improvement point was drawn after a comparison with foreign, advanced cases. Then, a modified design was proposed. Results The analysis results identified problems such as the distortion of the government symbol's shape, the distortion of the government symbol's spatial orientation, the exposure of the background color, the error of application in the use of a solid color gradation and solid color, the distortion of the border line's shape, and a invasion of clear space were found. It was found that the form of the governmental symbol needs to have ""vertical and horizontal clarity"" and a ""closed shape."" Conclusions It was suggested to use an intervening element as a design improvement direction of the government's symbolic mark to have ""clarity of verticality and horizontality,"" a ""closed shape,"" or close the opened part of the symbolic mark, and use the clear space of the white border line shape or white rectangle as the default. It was found that the greatest suggestion for improvement was to use the clear space of the white rectangle. The government's symbolic mark is used by a vast number of subordinate agencies. Thus, such agencies ought to exhibit uniformity in the usage of the symbolic mark through effortless application.

Unlike most emergency systems, which were based on only sound, emergency pictogram systems provide warning messages that consists of a combination of visual information, vibration, and flashing lights. Methods The research was carried out by investigating incidents that deaf people had experienced during emergency situations. A survey was conducted on 10 hearing-impaired students in order to discuss the problems and solutions for the inconvenience that had occurred while communicating warning messages in urgent situations. Based on the results from the survey, warning message system models were been formed by combining pictograms, various effects and a wearable device. In order to select the most effective model, the investigation was conducted with the help of five hearing-impaired volunteers. Results The results from the survey and analysis showed that the main reason that the heraing-impaired people could not receive the emergency information immediately was because most it was delivered through sound. In addition, it was found that hearing-impaired people were mostly dependent on smart-devices such as mobile phones' vibration functions in emergency situations. Therefore, a new warning message was developed by using a mixture of pictograms, flashing lights and vibration. Conclusions The purpose of developing a pictogram emergency system was to provide additional functions such as smart-devices for hearing-impaired people who have only been acquiring sound systems.

In order to predict crack propagation inside the rail, it is necessary to investigate the stress generated at the crack tip, and it is necessary to analyze the behavior of cracks that occur inside rails due to contact between wheel and rail. In this study, the fracture modes of subsurface cracks due to contact load between wheel and rail are analyzed using finite element analysis. The finite element analysis, which is used to simulate wheels and rails using 3-D solid elements and parameterized 2 mm subsurface cracks of rails with tilt angles (0°, 45°, 90°). Results obtained using the analytical model were confirmed as appropriate in comparison with results obtained by theoretical expression. As a result of the finite element analysis, the maximum stress due to contact between wheel and rail was found to be generated at a depth of about 5-7 mm from the rail surface. When there is a crack in a rail, the maximum stress occurs at the crack tip. As the crack inclination approaches the vertical direction, mode I and mode II types of cracking increase, and mode III cracking decreases. Therefore, in order to predict the subsurface crack propagation of a rail due to different fracture modes and depending on crack inclination angle, multi-axial fatigue analysis is required. © 2018 The Korean Society for Railway.

The proposed circuit consists of a low noise neural amplifier and a programmable gain amplifier with additional gain and bandwidth control to process signals in the 1 Hz to several kHz frequency band. The capacitive-feedback neural amplifier is designed using a complementary cascode input operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for improved noise characteristics. The programmable gain amplifier, also based on capacitive-feedback architecture with a current mirror OTA, allows control of high-pass cutoff frequencies from sub-1 Hz to 220 Hz and low-pass cutoff frequencies from 530 Hz to 8.9 kHz. In addition, capacitive feedback with programmable cross-coupled input capacitors allows gain control from 6 dB to 24 dB without distortion. An integrated input noise of 4.74 μVrms and noise efficiency factor of 2.91 are measured for the overall AFE IC at maximum gain setting. The IC consumes 2.28 μW of power from a 1-V supply and occupies 0.16 mm² of die area. © 2018, Institute of Electronics Engineers of Korea.

Owing to design flexibility and complexity, design for AM (DFAM) has received increasing attention as a new design method that can overcome traditional manufacturing constraints, and has been applied to multi-components integration, multi-material parts, and lightweight structures. In this study, an automatic design methodology for conformal lightweight structures was developed based on a three-dimensional (3D) tetrahedral mesh. A numerical algorithm was developed to generate lightweight cellular structures via the following steps: (i) definition of a target solid; (ii) discretization of the target volume using a tetrahedral mesh; (iii) construction of a number of struts along the edges of every tetrahedral element; (iv) Boolean operation to unify the generated struts; and (v) preparation of output files for 3D printing and finite element analysis (FEA). This algorithm was then applied to generate conformal cellular structures with various shapes. Effects of lattice design parameters on the relevant density change were discussed. The designed cellular structures were then fabricated by AM, and their mechanical properties were evaluated by compression tests. The fabricated lightweight structures showed high specific stiffness and strength, and could support 10000 times heavier load than their own weight. © 2018, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Cellular structure; Design for additive manufacturing; Lightweight structure; Micro-lattice","3D printers; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Compression testing; High energy physics; Mesh generation; Struts; 3-D printing; Cellular structure; High specific stiffness; Micro-lattice; Numerical algorithms; Tetrahedral elements; Threedimensional (3-d); Traditional manufacturing; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052077164

The capacity of the power sources and the gear ratio of the torque coupler should be optimized simultaneously. However, since this process is excessively time-consuming, previous studies have selected the gear ratio of the torque coupler and then selected the capacity of power source. However, this approach cannot guarantee global optimization. In this paper, a feasible region is defined to satisfy the required performance of vehicle such as maximum speed, hill-climbing. and feasible points are selected inside the feasible region. In the conventional technique, the global optimal solution is obtained by simulating all feasible points. In the optimization technique, optimal points are simulated within the feasible region using several optimal search algorithms, such as the golden section search algorithm and the hillclimbing search algorithm.

CVT refers to a type of transmission which allows an engine to be operated independently with respect to the vehicle speed, with the engine torque and CVT gear ratio controlled in an integrated manner. In the proposed integrated control scheme, engine operating points which minimize the rate of instantaneous fuel consumption are calculated, and the engine target torque and target gear ratio are determined in an integrated manner based on the results of the calculations. Unlike the previous map-based control method, the method introduced in this study does not require an engine torque map or a CVT ratio map for tuning, and the engine torque and CVT ratio are controlled to minimize the amount of fuel used while satisfying the level of acceleration demand from the driver. The control scheme is based on the powertrain model, and the CVT response lag and transmission loss are also considered in the integrated control processes. The algorithm is simulated with various driving cycles, with the simulation results showing that the fuel economy performance of the vehicle system is improved with the newly suggested engine-CVT integrated control algorithm. © 2018, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Continuously variable transmission; Fuel consumption; Integrated control; Model-based control","Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Fuels; Integrated control; Torque; Variable speed transmissions; Vehicle transmissions; Continuous variable transmissions; Continuously variable transmission; Economy performance; Model based controls; Model-based OPC; Operating points; Powertrain modeling; Transmission loss; Engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048820437

To overcome this and remove cadmium from runoff, a new reactive filtration column is introduced. Sulfur functionalized polymer particles were successfully embedded onto the surface of alginate bead (DiS-algi) and simulated a real stormwater treatment filtration column. The DiS-algi shows 22.3mg/g of batch and 877μg/g of continuous flow sorption capacity. Also, the results for the new sorption material show that within 6mins half of the cadmium was removed with 31L/mg of Langmuir sorption affinity, outperforming an activated carbon filter. From a breakthrough test the reactive column shows complete uptake of cadmium from a contaminated flow, lasting two hours until reaching the breakthrough point. Furthermore, regeneration tests of the column verified its reusability. DiS-algi appears to be a viable new cadmium sorption material for airport derived stormwater runoff filtration systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.","Airport stormwater runoff; Cadmium removal; Polymer composite sorbent; Stormwater filtration","Activated carbon; Airports; Cadmium; Polymers; Reusability; Runoff; Sorption; Storm sewers; Sulfur compounds; Activated carbon filters; Cadmium contamination; Cadmium removal; Contamination levels; Functionalized polymers; Polymer composite; Storm water runoff; Stormwaters; Storms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048392571

In the cooling phase of injection molding, resin plasticization must be completed in the screw. This study examined the plasticization and flow behavior of polypropylene in injection molding screws using non-isothermal simulation. A standard screw and two types of barrier screws, the open-type, in which the barrier flight is open, and the closed-type, in which it is closed, were used. The geometry used in this simulation was wound using a channel model for a full three-dimensional flow simulation. Through non-isothermal simulation, the pressure distribution, melt flow, and temperature distribution were compared in terms of screw design. The experimental study revealed that in the open-type of the barrier screw, the solid bed and melt pool were well separated by the barrier flight, allowing for better melting than in the standard screw and the closed-type barrier screw. Simulation verified that resin melted better in the open-type barrier screw due to its easy inflow in the barrier flight and high temperature generation in the screw channel. The simulation results proved that the study of simulated flow and plasticization of resin in a screw is very useful for estimating screw performance.

In thermal papers such as receipts and tickets, BPA is used as a heat-activated developer. Cashiers are therefore suspected to be a vulnerable group of exposure to BPA, but neither contribution of receipt handling to the total body burden of BPA among cashiers, nor related health effects are well characterized. Female cashiers (n = 54) were recruited from seven retail shops of a major supermarket chain in Korea, and urinary levels of BPA and metabolic syndrome (MetS) related biomarkers were measured. In order to estimate the contribution of receipt handling to the body burden of BPA, an intervention was designed on the use of gloves: the subjects were asked not to wear gloves during the work for one week, and in the following week, to wear gloves. Urine samples were collected at pre-shift and post-shift for the first two consecutive days in each week, and urinary BPA concentrations were measured. In cashiers without gloves, about a two-fold increase in urinary BPA concentrations was observed after work-shift. When the cashiers wore gloves, however, urinary BPA levels showed no changes. Higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with greater levels of fasting insulin and insulin resistance. Our observation shows that receipt handling among the cashiers could double the BPA exposure levels at post-shift compared to those at pre-shift, and use of simple protective equipment such as gloves could effectively reduce the BPA exposure levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bisphenol A; Cashier; Dermal exposure; Metabolic syndrome; Receipt","Consumer products; Insulin; Metabolism; Wear of materials; Bis-phenol a; Cashier; Dermal exposure; Metabolic syndromes; Receipt; Phenols; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; biological marker; cholesterol; insulin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; biological marker; phenol derivative; biomarker; concentration (composition); metabolism; occupational exposure; organic compound; womens health; adult; Article; cashier; cholesterol blood level; construction work and architectural phenomena; diet restriction; female; female by occupation; human; insulin resistance; Korea; materials handling; metabolic syndrome X; occupational exposure; priority journal; receipt handling; supermarker; urine level; work schedule; analysis; body burden; insulin resistance; occupational exposure; physiology; South Korea; urine; Korea; Benzhydryl Compounds; Biomarkers; Body Burden; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Syndrome; Occupational Exposure; Phenols; Republic of Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047085577

To find the optimal ASM mode, the existing ASM schemes examine each error vector in the search space. By contrast, in the proposed SS-aided strategy, the search space is reduced to the error vectors inside a sphere, which results in significant complexity reduction. By exploiting a similar structure between the error vectors in ASM and symbol vectors in generalized spatial modulation (GSM), we modify the sphere decoder for GSM to develop an efficient two-step SS scheme for ASM. In addition, an early termination scheme is employed to further reduce the computational load of the SS process for each ASM mode. Simulation results show that SS-aided ASM provides a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to the existing ASM schemes. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","adaptive modulation, sphere decoding (SD); multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO); Spatial modulation (SM); sphere search (SS)","Adaptive modulation; Bit error rate; Computational complexity; Decoding; Errors; Global system for mobile communications; MIMO systems; Receiving antennas; Vector spaces; Vectors; Complexity theory; MIMO communication; Spatial modulations; Sphere decoding; Transmitting antenna; Modulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046994240

Methyl-2-acetylamino-3-(4-hydroxyl-3,5-dimethoxybenzoylthio)propanoate (MAHDP) is reported to anti-melanogenesis effect but its mechanism remain unclear. Objective: To investigate the effects of MAHDP on melanogenesis and elucidate its mechanism. Methods: Tyrosinase activity, melanogenic proteins and gene expression levels were measured with MAHDP treatment in B16F1 cells, human melanocytes, reconstructed skin and clinical trial. Results: MAHDP attenuated melanin production in α-MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone) stimulated-B16F1 cells. MAHDP decreased the expression of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), and tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2). But, MADPH did not affect the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNK and AKT, which are associated with the regulation of MITF expression. These results suggest that MITF downstream is regulated not transcriptionally but translationally. Treatment of MG132 (a proteasomal degradation inhibitor) almost abolished the decrease of MITF protein levels by MAHDP. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of MITF for proteasomal degradation were increased by treatment of MAHDP. Treatment of PD98059 (an ERK phosphorylation inhibitor) abrogated ERK phosphorylation, downregulation of MITF and tyrosinase as well as the decrease of melanin contents by MAHDP. Therefore, the degradation of MITF proteins by MAHDP is regulated to the ERK signaling. Finally, MAHDP improved the pigmentation in human epidermal melanocytes, a UVB-irradiated the reconstructed skin model and clinical trial without cytotoxicity and skin irritation. Conclusion: These results clearly demonstrate that MAHDP suppresses the expression of melanogenic enzymes through ERK phosphorylation-mediated MITF proteasomal degradation, and suggest that MAHDP may be efficient as a therapeutic agent for hyperpigmentation. © 2018 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology","A reconstructed human skin tissue; Depigmentation; ERK signaling pathway; Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; Proteasomal degradation","benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; depigmenting agent; dopachrome tautomerase; intermedin; melanin; methyl 2 acetylamino 3 (4 hydroxyl 3,5 dimethoxybenzoylthio)propanoate; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; monophenol monooxygenase; protein kinase B; stress activated protein kinase; tyrosinase related protein 1; unclassified drug; adult; animal cell; Article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; down regulation; drug mechanism; drug safety; enzymatic degradation; female; human; human cell; human tissue; hyperpigmentation; MAPK signaling; melanocyte; melanogenesis; nonhuman; pigmentation; priority journal; proteasomal degradation; protein degradation; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; translation regulation; ubiquitination; ultraviolet B radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046629732

Although these functions are clearly dependent on visibility, the practical application of broken lines differs greatly worldwide in terms of the ratio of the line segment to the gap length or the width of the markings. On Korean freeways, existing broken-line markings consist of 8-m line segments and a 12-m gap with a width of 15 cm, although the reasoning for these dimensions is not known. The present study began with the field installation of diverse broken-line marking alternatives under the regulated ratio of the line segment to the gap segment—that is, 1:2 in Korea. Using the installed markings, a visibility experiment with subjects riding in a vehicle moving at a speed of 100 km/h was performed. From this study, it can be concluded that the existing broken-line markings on Korean freeways are not ideal in terms of visibility and that broken-line markings with 6-m line segments and a 12-m gap with a width of 13 cm is preferred in terms of visibility. This alternative was recommended to later become the new nationwide standard for Korean freeways. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","broken line; crash; freeway; marking; traffic safety; visibility","Highway accidents; Highway systems; broken line; crash; Gap length; High-speed conditions; Line segment; marking; Traffic crashes; Traffic safety; Visibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033463339

Paclitaxel (PTX) is widely used in DESs to suppress neointima, which causes restenosis. However, the PTX release profile is slow owing to its hydrophobic properties, resulting in negative effects on re-endothelialization in vessels. In this study, we assessed the effects of the controlled release of PTX particles of specific sizes on in-stent restenosis (ISR). PTX particle sizes were controlled by adjusting the evaporating temperature of the solvent from 25 to 80°C during ultrasonic coating, and DESs were prepared. The properties of prepared films and DESs were analyzed, and cell viability was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/PTX500-loaded stents showed the most rapid release for 58 days, and smaller drug particles exhibited lower PTX release rates. In vivo, PLGA/PTX50-, PLGA/PTX250-, and PLGA/PTX500-loaded stents showed good efficacy for alleviating ISR as compared with bare metal stents and PLGA/PTX5-loaded stents. However, PLGA/PTX250- and PLGA/PTX500-loaded stents exhibited strut exposure and reduced recovery of the vascular compared with PLGA/PTX50-loaded stents. PTX drug particles of approximately 50 nm were most effective in vivo, and the control of particle size is a promising strategy for improving the performance of PTX-eluting stents. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A method to link 4D objects and AR objects is proposed in order to implement several types of schedule information, as well as to enable the use of constantly changing schedule information through AR objects. Furthermore, a method for implementing AR objects based on connecting real-time field images is presented to help long distance managers become more accustomed to virtual objects and to enable better reflecting field environmental conditions in schedule management.

The MG should be able to operate in both islanded and grid-connected modes. A sudden failure of ac utility grids can lead to an inoperable condition of the MG or a large transient phenomenon accompanied by oscillation and overshoot during the mode transition. This paper proposes a control scheme of the bidirectional dc-dc converter for the ESS to resolve the issue associated with mode switching.

Recently, an average of 96 cases of HCS accidents have taken place in South Korea annually. As a result, the government is trying to reduce the incidence of HCS accidents by 50%. Government officials are seeking information about the value that the enforcement of the reduction plan will bring for the public. This knowledge will help government officials decide whether to implement the reduction plan. This article seeks to acquire information about the public willingness to pay (WTP) for the reduction plan, employing the contingent valuation (CV) technique. For this purpose, a total of 1000 households living in South Korea participated in the CV survey in 2017. The data on the WTP were gathered using a dichotomous choice question and analyzed using the spike model. Forty-five percent of the respondents were willing to accept an increase in income taxes to carry out the reduction plan. The mean household WTP estimate was obtained as KRW3830 (USD 3.41) per annum. The national value expanded from the sample to the population is worth KRW 74.8 billion (USD 66.6 million) per year. This value implies the public value of the reduction plan and can be applied in policy analysis and decision-making concerning the reduction of the incidence of HCS accidents. © 2018 by the authors.","Contingent valuation; Hazardous chemical spill accident; Public value; Willingness to pay","accident; contingent valuation; decision making; environmental economics; government; oil spill; willingness to pay; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051076297

However, MST devices transmit magnetic signals to a remote magstripe card reader. Hence, it is possible to eavesdrop on such signals.

Thus, we could obtain the one-time payment token contained in such signals at a maximum distance of 2.7 m.

To improve the reliability of transmission under such scenario, we use a symbol repetition scheme to the DPSK modulation, such as the IEEE 802.15.6 wireless body area network and the ITU-T G.9903. However, the message symbol repetition with interleaving in conventional manner as in coherent modulation schemes may degrade the receiver performance because of the noise characteristic of the differential demodulation structure. In this work, we analyze the performance of repeated DPSK system with and without the interleaver and demonstrate which scenario is suitable for each modulation order. We propose a proper transmission setting, which achieves noticeable performance improvement at the receiver as well as enhances the energy efficiency of the communication system. Since it can be implemented with very small modification to existing systems, our results are highly applicable with negligible modification of the hardware structure and thus enable substantially low-cost implementation in future communication systems including wireless body area network internet of things applications.

One tryptophan-like (C1), one fulvic-like (C2), and one humic-like (C3) components were identified in the leachates. The removal behaviors of the individual fluorescent components were dependent upon the operation conditions, suggesting the existence of unique characteristics with respect to the responses to the oxidation mechanisms, which were likely altered by different operation conditions. For all tested conditions, a greater extent of removal was consistently found for C3 versus C1 and C2 except for the relatively high pH ranges (&gt;6.0), in which C2 presented the highest removal rates. 2D-COS combined with synchronous fluorescence spectra exhibited the preferential oxidation sequence in the order of C3 &gt; C1 &gt; C2 with higher H2O2 doses. 2D-COS coupled with Fourier transform infrared (2D-COS-FTIR) showed that aromatic functional groups were initially oxidized, followed by the removal of carboxylic groups and the formation of inorganic functional groups and aldehyde or ketonic groups. Hetero 2D-COS maps further revealed the close association between the aromatic groups and C3, and between the carboxylic groups and C1.

Yeast cultivated from S. cerevisiae is used as biocatalyst, while glucose is the substrate. For the pretreatment of felt, acetone, nitric acid, and polyethyleneimine are employed. First the optimal conditions for yeast cultivation are quantitatively determined. As a result, a high yeast growth rate (1.083 h−1) and the optimal yeast growing time (48 h) for cell tests are obtained. The differently pretreated felts are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and optical microscopy. Conductivity, charge transfer resistance, and CdbndO and CsbndN groups dangled on the felt are crucial parameters determining the performance of the microbial fuel cell. Particularly, the conjugation effects of pi-pi bonds and lone pairs facilitating the attachment of yeast to the CdbndO and CsbndN groups on the carbon felt promote (i) mutual adhesion between them and (ii) growth of yeast on CF-PEI. This correlation is confirmed by optical analysis of the felts after the cell tests. To evaluate the early-stage performance of the microbial fuel cells using the different felts, polarization curves are measured. In the measurements, the maximum power density of the cells depends on the superficial state of felts, while the performance of the cell using the PEI-treated felt is best, at 256.3 ± 11.5 mW·m−2.

Current NAND flash memory uses a low threshold voltage to satisfy the industry standard, which requires data retention of more than a year, and as a result its write operation latency tends to increase as semiconductor process technology progresses. However, actual server workload analysis indicates that much of the data are short-lived and do not require a long retention time. Writing those short-lived data slowly with a low threshold voltage is inefficient. Fast write with a high threshold voltage should be employed for short-lived data and slow write should be employed only for long-lived data. Therefore, this work proposes a method that predicts the lifetime of data based on write request size and selectively applies fast write to short-lived data. The results of evaluations using representative server workloads on an SSD simulator indicate that the proposed method improves an average performance by up to 41.14% compared with the existing method.

The major cause of the DVR phenomenon is related to the dynamic characteristics of induction motor (IM) loads. The deaccelerating and stalling of the IM load during disturbances is the main driving force of short-term voltage instability, resulting in an amount of reactive power consumption and excessive current draw. With the economic efficiency of energy use, the proportion of IM loads is gradually increasing, and this trend might deteriorate system stability. This paper focuses on the impact of IM loads in the Korean power system and analyzes the parameter sensitivity of IM loads and the proportion of appropriate IM loads. The proposed procedure for under voltage load shedding (UVLS) applies voltage stability criteria to decide the most efficient load shedding scheme.

The high-strength reinforced steel bars (600 D13, 600 D16 and 700 D13 specimens) are fabricated by a TempCore process, while the seismic reinforced steel bar (600S D16 specimen) is fabricated by air cooling after hot rolling. For specimens fabricated by the TempCore process, the 600 D13 and 600 D16 specimens have a microstructure of tempered martensite in the surface region and ferrite-pearlite in the center region, while the 700 D13 specimen has a microstructure of tempered martensite in the surface region and bainite in the center region. Therefore, their hardness is the highest in the surface region and shows a tendency to decrease from the surface region to the center region because tempered martensite has a higher hardness than ferrite-pearlite or bainite. However, the hardness of the 600S D16 specimen, which is composed of fully ferritepearlite, increases from the surface region to the center region because the pearlite volume fraction increases from the surface region to the center region. On the other hand, the tensile test results indicate that only the 700 D13 specimen with a higher carbon content exhibits continuous yielding behavior due to the formation of bainite in the center region. The 600S D16 specimen has the highest tensile-to-yield ratio because the presence of ferrite-pearlite and precipitates caused by vanadium addition largely enhances work hardening. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","High strength; Microstructure; Reinforced steel bar; Seismic resistant; Tensile property","Bainite; Bars (metal); Earthquake engineering; Ferrite; Hardness; Hot rolling; Martensite; Microstructure; Pearlite; Reinforcement; Seismology; Strain hardening; Tensile properties; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Ferrite-pearlite; High strength; Reinforced steel; Seismic resistant; Tempcore process; Tempered martensite; Vanadium addition; Yielding behavior; High strength steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052480488

Compared to the other samples, the WO3 films fabricated at a heating rate of 5 °C/min shows superior EC performances for transmittance modulation(49.5%), response speeds(8.3 s in a colored state and 11.2 s in a bleached state), and coloration efficiency(37.3 cm2/C).

Recently commercialized walking rehabilitation robots have several drawbacks such as high price, large volume, heavy weight, and uncomfortable fit; hence, they still have limitations in terms of popularity and marketability. To resolve these issues, we developed a novel walking rehabilitation robot with three strategies. First, a five-link mechanism and curved foot landing surface were optimally designed so that the position and angle trajectories of the end-effector can coincide with the foot walking trajectory of a normal person. Second, the price, weight, and volume were minimized by connecting the two link mechanisms with a shaft and driving it using a single-gear motor. Third, we proposed three walking rehabilitation modes based on the degree of disability and walking intention. Finally, the power assist performance of each mode was experimentally verified through EMG measurement. © 2018 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.",,"End effectors; EMG measurement; Large volumes; Link mechanisms; Power assist; Power assistance; Rehabilitation robot; Walking intentions; Walking trajectory; Walking aids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051203533

This study conducted microscale embossing and punching experiments by establishing a forming system that uses a laser induced acceleration. The changes in the flyer velocity with the laser energy, flyer thickness, and flyer diameter were measured using a high speed camera, and the effects of the noted acceleration characteristics of flyers on processing performance were investigated. It is particularly important that in the case of punching, the advantages of high speed processing, in which the accuracy was improved by increasing the shear zone of the workpiece, were identified. Significantly in the case of embossing, it was observed that the formability improved by increasing the flyer velocity as the flyer diameter decreased. However, in the case when the flyer thickness was decreased, increased energy was consumed in the plastic deformation of the flyer, and the advantages of high speed forming could not be realized. For this reason, further research is needed to take advantage and optimize the forming process using the laser induced acceleration through experiments which are noted as considering the various process variables and materials.

In this study, AS-treated waxy corn starch was retrograded by temperature cycling, and the effects of storage conditions on the structure and digestibility of the starch were investigated. Findings: Amylosucrase-treated waxy corn starch had a larger amount of long chains (degree of polymerization ≥25) than the control starch and exhibited amylose-like behavior. Temperature cycling induced the reassociation of the elongated chains of AS-treated starch and accelerated retrogradation, causing rapid and significant increases (p < 0.05) in melting enthalpy, relative crystallinity, and resistant starch (RS) content compared to those observed during isothermal storage. Conclusions: Structural changes affected the reassociation and/or melting properties of starch, as the two starches (control starch and AS-treated starch) had different favored steps of retrogradation (propagation and nucleation, respectively) during temperature-cycling storage. Significance and novelty: This study provided information on retrogradation-related changes in the properties of AS-treated starch. Temperature-cycled retrogradation can be used as a physical modification method to enhance the RS content of AS-treated starch, allowing AS-treated starch to be used as a low-glycemic index ingredient. © 2018 AACC International","amylosucrase; in vitro digestibility; retrogradation; structural properties; temperature cycling; waxy corn starch",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049305310

How this blur affects a 3D image was investigated using the commercial multi-view 3D. The 3D input signal consisted of the square pattern and the gratings of various width and gray level values of G1 and G2. The various combinations of G1 and G2 were used to investigate the dependence of blur on gray G1 and G2 values. The 3D depth caused blurring, which caused a decrease in contrast modulation. Hence, the 3D resolution determined from contrast modulation was affected by the depth and became worse with increasing depth. Therefore, 3D resolution may be used to define the depth range within which the image degradation due to blurring is acceptable. Blur edge width values at the boundaries of gray G1 and G2 were measured and found to be similar irrespective of G1 and G2 values at the same depth. This was because blur was caused by the incomplete separation of views that are independent of G1 and G2. Hence, the blurriness of the observed 3D image is determined only by the depth. The 3D resolution and blur edge width might be useful to characterize the performance of auto-stereoscopic multi-view 3D. © Copyright 2018 Society for Information Display","auto-stereoscopic 3D; resolution","Modulation; Optical resolving power; Stereo image processing; 3D resolution; Auto stereoscopic; Blur edge widths; Depth range; Gray level values; Image degradation; Multi-views; Square patterns; Three dimensional displays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047628212

Conventionally, the concept of interdisciplinarity has been measured indirectly through using historical data and estimating how frequently the knowledge is exchanged among various disciplinary fields. However, they were incapable of determining whether a certain discipline may turn out to be a successful interdisciplinary research field in the future. This paper, in response, highlights the significance of data points appearing in the future for predicting the degree of interdisciplinarity in academic fields. To this mean, the future data points are predicted through a stochastic basis, and they are further used to predict the future degree of disciplinary convergence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we have selected the case of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary academic field where diverse scientific and engineering disciplines merge with one another and contributes to various scientific development and social problem solving. In details, citation data of nanotechnology journals are gathered to estimate the expected citation frequency through a stochastic model, called Glänzel–Schubert–Schoepflin model, and its future potential of IDR is predicted through a diversity index. The result of the analysis predicted that the IDR of nanotechnology will be actively occurred with other disciplines such as chemistry, material science and energy in the future, and it also holds higher probability of being more frequently conducted compared to other field of studies. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Citation analysis; Diversity; Glänzel–Schubert–Schoepflin model; Interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinary research (IDR)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045756610

The proposed method requires just two preliminary I-V characterizations of IGBT modules.

However, when a large data stream is transmitted, overhead results from the difference between the speed and maximum transfer unit of IoT and the existing Internet. The overhead increases as data size increases. This problem is a critical factor for IoT devices that are sensitive to power consumption and data streams that must be handled in real time. To solve this problem, we compressed the data stream using a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Since compression using the LDPC code can be applied even when the data stream is encrypted, the compression can be used in applications requiring privacy or confidentiality. Therefore, this study proposes a method to improve the usability of encrypted data streams in the IoT environment. We implemented IoT devices that generated data streams using Raspberry Pi, a desktop computer, and collectors that collect data streams. The results of experiments using temperature sensor data show that the communication time for data stream transmission decreased by 56.1–75.5%. In addition, the power consumption of IoT devices for data transmission decreased by 54.8–75.3%. In order to perform compression handling by the IoT device, the maximum memory usage and CPU usage increased by 0.3% and 10.1%, respectively. As a result of this research, it is expected that the transmission time to collectors, as well as the power consumption of IoT devices, can be reduced while securing data streams generated by IoT devices. © 2017","IoT; Secure data stream; Usability","Computer hardware description languages; Cryptography; Data communication systems; Data handling; Electric power utilization; Forward error correction; Heterogeneous networks; Satellite communication systems; Communication time; Data stream transmission; Internet of Things (IOT); Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes; Maximum transfer unit; Secure data; Transmission time; Usability; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020102782

In particular, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites have higher mechanical strength than single-walled carbon nanotube composites. This work investigates the methods for analytically evaluating and predicting the mechanical properties of MWCNT-reinforced nanocomposites to enable their effective mechanical design. First, the correlation between the thickness of the interphase region (between the carbon nanotubes and the polymer matrix) and the mechanical properties of the MWCNT-reinforced composite was studied. Next, the effect of the relative distribution of carbon nanotubes in the matrix on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites fabricated by injection molding was evaluated. Finally, the effect of agglomerate size on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites was investigated, and a critical size for carbon nanotube agglomerates was analytically proposed. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Carbon nanotube; MWCNT-reinforced composite; RVE model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047665864

However, the electrocatalysts of the anode are vulnerable in terms of their electrochemical performance, as they can be easily toxified by CO and other hydrocarbons, which might lead to a break-up of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). For further advances in the DMFC industry with improved electrochemical performance, this issue should be urgently resolved. Thus, this study proposes a novel approach to synthesize protein-based carbon as platinum electrocatalyst supports (PCPs) from tofu using a carbonization for the improved methanol oxidation activities. Among commercial Pt/C and other samples, the composite loaded 10 wt% Pt electrocatalyst showed the highest anodic current density of 510 mA mgPt−1, the excellent electrocatalytic stability, and the highest retention of 86%. The improved electrochemical performances can be attributed to the good dispersion of Pt electrocatalysts and N-doping effect of protein-based carbon supports. These results suggest that PCPs derived from tofu will be one of promising candidates as platinum catalyst supports to improve methanol oxidation activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","High electrochemical performance; Methanol oxidation; Nitrogen doping; Protein based carbon; Pt electrocatalysts","Carbon; Carbonization; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Oxidation; Platinum; Proteins; Renewable energy resources; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs); Electrochemical performance; Low operating temperature; Methanol Oxidation; Methanol oxidation reactions; Nitrogen-doping; Platinum electrocatalysts; Pt electrocatalysts; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045309901

Therefore, the government requires quantitative information to be provided about the economic benefits of industrial NG (ING) use to decide whether to invest in expanding the supply of ING or not. This manuscript tries to measure the economic benefits of NG use in the manufacturing industry by using a specific case in South Korea. For this purpose, a trans-log production function is estimated using the data collected from a national survey of 1100 firms in South Korea. Of them, 299 firms used ING. For a representative manufacturing firm, the point estimated for the economic benefits of ING use is obtained as KRW 2409 (USD 2.07) per m3, which is statistically meaningful. The average price of ING, which is defined as the total expenditure on ING purchased in 2016 and divided by the total amount of ING purchased in 2016, was KRW667 (USD 0.57) per m3. Therefore, the economic benefits of ING use are 3.61 times as great as the average price of ING. This implies that ING produces more value than its price in South Korea. © 2018 by the authors.","Economic benefits; Industrial natural gas; Input; Trans-log production function; Value of marginal product","economic conditions; firm size; government; industrial production; input-output analysis; manufacturing; measurement method; natural gas; price determination; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049233059

Catastrophe fuzzy theory and data clustering methods were used to avoid subjectivity in the estimation of the index of multiple climate indicators. The proposed index was used for the estimation of geographical distribution of hydrological hazard susceptibility index (HHSI) in Peninsular Malaysia using gauge-based, gridded rainfall and temperature data for the period 1948-2010. The results showed that the northeast regions of Peninsular Malaysia are more susceptible to hydrological hazard, which matches very well with the general conception of the hydrological hazard susceptible zones. Assessment of susceptibility for sliding different 30-year periods between 1950 and 2010 revealed that HHSI has increased in the south and decreased in the northeast of the peninsula. The decrease in temporal and spatial variability of rainfall in the northeast and the increase in other parts can become the causes of spatial changes in hazard susceptibility. The changes of HHSI in recent years compared to the base period revealed the increase of hazard susceptibility in the south in the range of 8.81% to 21.01%, while a significant decrease (> -31.84%) was observed in the northeast. © 2018 by the authors.","Aridity; Fuzzy catastrophe theory; Hydrological hazard susceptibility index (HHSI); Hydrological hazards; Rainfall variability","aridity; geographical distribution; hazard assessment; hydrological hazard; index method; rainfall; spatial variation; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049175203

The contact forces between material particles and finite elements are computed at the (background) grid nodes in material point method, and transferred to finite element nodes. A weighted average method is used to obtain the velocities at grid nodes contributed from finite element nodes, and a cut-off weight is applied to the contact condition to avoid an early contact occurring in a grid-based contact algorithm. A severe penetration of material particles into finite elements when the finite element mesh is coarser than the background grid can be prevented by introducing distributed interaction (DI) nodes on the contact faces of finite elements.

The key element to the successful Hamiltonian reduction is finding the privileged spacetime coordinates in which physical degrees of freedom manifestly reside in the conformal two-metric, and all the other metric components are determined by the conformal two-metric. In the privileged coordinates, Einstein's constraint equations become trivial; the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are simply the defining equations of a nonvanishing gravitational Hamiltonian and momentum densities in terms of conformal two-metric and its conjugate momentum, respectively. Thus, given any conformal two-metric, which is a constraint-free data, one can construct the whole four-dimensional spacetime by integrating the first-order superpotential equations. As the first examples of using Hamiltonian reduction in solving Einstein's equations, we found two exact solutions to Einstein's equations in the privileged coordinates. Suitable coordinate transformations from the privileged to the standard coordinates show that they are just the Einstein-Rosen wave and the Schwarzschild solution. The local gravitational Hamiltonian and momentum densities of these spacetimes are also presented in the privileged coordinates. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","(2 + 2) formalism; Hamiltonian reduction; problem of time; solution generating methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048118391

Sensor 1 exhibited a ratiometric fluorescence emission for Ag+ from blue to sky. The binding mode of 1 and Ag+ turned out to be a 1: 1 ratio as determined using Job plot and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectral analyses. The sensing mechanism of 1 with silver ion was unravelled by1 H NMR titrations and theoretical calculations. Sensor 1 also discerned sulfide by enhancing fluorescence intensity and changing colour from yellow to colourless in aqueous solution. The sensing properties of 1 toward S2− were investigated by using ESI-mass analysis, Job plot and1 H NMR titrations. Moreover, 1 could be used as a detector for sulfide in a wide pH range. © 2018 The Authors.","Chemosensor; Colorimetric; Fluorescent; Silver; Sulfide; Theoretical calculations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048581865

The hybrid supercapacitors fabricated with LTO/CNT anode with 3 wt% CNT and activated carbon (AC) cathode deliver superior electrochemical performances. It is mainly ascribed to the reduced charge-transfer resistance and improved ionic and electronic conductivity, resulting from smooth and rapid lithium ion kinetics and electron diffusion by suppression of particle growth and aggregation. Moreover, elastic properties of CNT can alleviate the volume change of LTO during charge-discharge process, resulting in excellent cycle performance.

The towers are connected using power lines that are installed with a proper sag by loosening the cable to lower the tension and to secure the sufficient clearance from the ground or nearby objects. The power line sag may extend over the tolerance due to the weather such as strong winds, temperature changes, and a heavy snowfall. Therefore the periodical mapping of the power lines is required but the poor accessibility to the power lines limit the work because most power lines are placed at the mountain area. In addition, the manual mapping of the power lines is also time-consuming either using the terrestrial surveying or the aerial surveying. Therefore we utilized multiple overlapping images acquired from a low-cost drone to automatically reconstruct the power lines in the object space. Two overlapping images are selected for epipolar image resampling, followed by the line extraction for the resampled images and the redundant images. The extracted lines from the epipolar images are matched together and reconstructed for the power lines primitive that are noisy because of the multiple line matches. They are filtered using the extracted line information from the redundant images for final power lines points. The experiment result showed that the proposed method successfully generated parabolic curves of power lines by interpolating the power lines points though the line extraction and reconstruction were not complete in some part due to the lack of the image contrast. © 2018 Korean Society of Surveying.

and the second one possibly in Korea at a later stage. Having the second detector in Korea would benefit almost all areas of neutrino oscillation physics, mainly due to longer baselines. There are several candidate sites in Korea with baselines of 1000-1300 km and OAAs of 1°-3°. We conducted sensitivity studies on neutrino oscillation physics for a second detector, either in Japan (JD × 2) or Korea (JD + KD), and compared the results with a single detector in Japan. Leptonic charge-parity (CP) symmetry violation sensitivity is improved, especially when the CP is non-maximally violated. The larger matter effect at Korean candidate sites significantly enhances sensitivities to non-standard interactions of neutrinos and mass ordering determination. Current studies indicate the best sensitivity is obtained at Mt. Bisul (1088 km baseline, 1.3° OAA). Thanks to a larger (1000 m) overburden than the first detector site, clear improvements to sensitivities for solar and supernova relic neutrino searches are expected. © The Author(s) 2018.","C03; C04; C12; C32; C43",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051241848

Thus, it is important to estimate the fracture behaviors of PIPs for integrity assessment of this unique piping system. In this work, the plastic collapse behaviors of PIPs with circumferential through-wall cracks (TWCs) are investigated based on three-dimensional finite element (FE) limit analysis, where the crack is assumed to be located at the inner pipe of PIPs.

A LOS MIMO link may be distorted by the influence of environmental factors such that the channel capacity of the LOS MIMO link may be degraded. By using the proposed method, the channel capacity of a distorted 2×2 LOS MIMO link can be the same as that of the ideal 2×2 LOS MIMO link. The proposed method employs an additional receiver antenna to maximize the channel capacity. In contrast to a 3×2 LOS MIMO link, a receiver circuit for a third receiving antenna is not necessary. Hence, the receiver for the proposed method is much simpler than that for a 3×2 LOS MIMO link. We determine the optimal position of the additional receiver antenna analytically.

Olive oil esters with short (S) and long (L) reaction times were studied. From the TLC-image analysis, composition ratios of the olive oil esters S were found to be 5.2, 24.1, 46.4, and 21.9% for mono-, di-, tri-glyceride, and fatty acid ethyl ester, respectively. Those of the olive oil esters L were 4.1, 24.7, 40.6, and 28.8% for mono-, di-, tri-glyceride, and fatty acid ethyl ester, respectively. The iodine value, acid value, saponification value, unsaponified matter, refractive index, and specific gravity were determined and purity tests were also carried out and normalized to establish standards and testing methods for using olive oil esters in cosmetics. To evaluate their emulsifying capacities, the O/W emulsion was prepared without surfactants and the formation of the emulsified particles were confirmed. After 5 days of applying the olive oil esters to human skin, the skin moisture retention was improved by 13.1% from the initial state. For the evaluation of toxicity on human skin cells, the olive oil esters showed 90% or more of the cell viability at 0.2-200 µg/mL.

The relationship of the above-mentioned parameters with the conductivity of the silver nanoparticle pattern formed on the printed surface was explored. The experimental results showed that chloride ions on the surface of photo papers activated the decomposition of a capping agent and sintering between the silver nanoparticles. It was also found that the chloride ions above a certain value did not affect the sintering. The surface roughness and pore size of the photo papers were found to be inversely related to the conductivity of electrode pattern. Moreover, it was found that additional heat treatment (for a relatively short time at a low temperature) contributed to the improvement of conductivity.

In this paper, we propose a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI)-based current control method for the interlink converter. As the main features here, the interlink converter permits bidirectional power exchange between both sub-grids when a power–demand imbalance occurs in one sub-grid regardless of the converter system parameters.

Four trapezium shapes of stenoses were considered by varying contraction, plateau, and expansion parts of stenoses for different stenosis area reduction ratios. The Galerkin finite element method based on the P2P1 mixed element was employed to solve the axisymmetric incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity equation. The proposed numerical method was validated by solving a benchmark problem of stenotic flow. It was found that the average pressure profile along the centerline was more affected by the contraction shape than the expansion shape. It was also revealed that the average wall shear stress of mild contraction was greater than that of sudden contraction around the stenotic region. Furthermore, the pressure drop across the stenosis was found to be associated with the form drag experienced by the stenosis. © 2018, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Finite element method; Pressure drop; Pulsatile flow; Shape of stenosis; Wall shear stress","Computational fluid dynamics; Drag; Drops; Finite element method; Flow fields; Incompressible flow; Numerical methods; Pressure drop; Pulsatile flow; Shear flow; Shear stress; Area reduction ratios; Bench-mark problems; Continuity equations; Galerkin finite element methods; Incompressible Navier Stokes equations; Shape of stenosis; Sudden contraction; Wall shear stress; Navier Stokes equations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048802527

The conventional method employed to obtain the ACC from three-dimensional radiation patterns is costly and difficult to measure. An alternate method is to use the S-parameters, which can be easily measured using a network analyzer. However, this method assumes that the antennas are highly efficient, and it is therefore not suitable for lossy MIMO antenna arrays. To overcome this limitation, we define and utilize the non-coupled radiation efficiency in the S-parameter-based ACC formula. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by the simulation results of a 4-port highly coupled lossy MIMO array. Further, the proposed method can be applied to N-port arrays by expanding the calculation matrix. © 2018 ETRI","Antenna correlation coefficient (ACC); Antenna impedance; Embedded radiation efficiency; MIMO antenna; Non-coupled radiation efficiency; Scattering parameter","Antenna arrays; Efficiency; MIMO systems; Scattering parameters; Alternate method; Antenna correlation; Antenna impedance; Conventional methods; MIMO antenna; Multiple input multiple output antennas; Radiation efficiency; Three dimensional radiation; Directional patterns (antenna)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048626998

The grain size and microstructure fraction of the API X80 linepipe steels were quantitatively measured by EBSD analysis and then tensile tests were carried out on them. Although all the steels showed complex microstructures of polygonal ferrite (PF), and bainitic microstructures such as acicular ferrite (AF), granular bainite (GB), and bainitic ferrite (BF), they had different grain sizes and microstructure fractions. The D steel with the finest grain size showed the highest yield strength due to grain refinement strengthening even though it had a relatively high fraction of PF with lower yield strength. The yield ratio usually increases with decreasing grain size because grain refinement typically produces an increase in yield strength and a decrease in work hardening due to the accumulation of dislocations at grain boundaries. On the other hand, uniform elongation increases with increasing PF fraction because an increase in the PF fraction eases slip and thus reduces plastic instability caused by accumulated dislocations at grain boundaries. Consequently, the microstructural factors affecting the yield ratio, uniform elongation, and work hardening exponent of the API X80 linepipe steels are different, and the work hardening exponent is considered to be a parameter affected by stress and strain simultaneously. Therefore, it was confirmed that there is no general correlation between yield ratios, uniform elongations, and work hardening exponents in the API X80 linepipe steels investigated in this study, and previously reported API linepipe steels.

The phases were formed by the dissolution and precipitation of Cu, and the three-dimensional linkage of irregular polygonal Cu6Sn5 phases using the acicular Cu6Sn5 through a Bi phase of the highest electrical resistivity. The reaction time, which was prolonged up to 180 s during the reaction at 190 oC, maximized the number of acicular Cu6Sn5 and irregular polygonal Cu6Sn5 phases, through the formation of fine Cu6Sn5 phases by splitting behavior of coarse Cu6Sn5 phases.

Because these providers collect waste heat from garbage incineration plants, power plants, or industrial processes of steel and chemical companies, as well as heat generated through combined heat and power plants and boilers. IH is an important input, used in industrial production as a form of hot water or steam. This note tries to assess the marginal value (MV) of IH in the manufacturing industry, using the specific case of Korea. To this end, a trans-log production function is estimated using the data gathered from a survey of 256 manufacturing firms in Korea. The MV of IH is estimated to be KRW 203,696 (USD 175.40) per tonne. This estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level. The average price of IH, defined as total expenditure on IH purchased in 2016 divided by total amount of IH purchased in 2016, is KRW 39,455 (USD 34.00) per tonne. Therefore, the MV of IH is about five times as large as the average price of IH. © 2018 by the authors.","Industrial heat; Industrial production; Marginal value; Trans-log production function","atmospheric pollution; chemical industry; combined heat and power; energy efficiency; expenditure; heating; incineration; industrial emission; industrial production; manufacturing; marginalization; power plant; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047785185

This study conducted microscale punching experiments using a laser-accelerated flyer for various mold sizes, workpiece thicknesses, and flyer thicknesses to investigate performance and failure characteristics of the punching process. In the case of a single flyer impact, punching was successful when the ratio of mold diameter to workpiece thickness exceeded 3. High-speed punching advantages, which improve punching quality as the shear zone increases and burrs become smaller, were validated. When flyer thickness was significantly reduced, punching performance deteriorated although higher speed could be realized, because the thinner flyer was difficult to maintain flatness during acceleration, resulting in inefficient forming pressure transfer to the workpiece. When the ratio of mold diameter to workpiece thickness was less than 3, punching was achieved through multiple flyer impacts. However, pressure transfer efficiency from the flyer to the workpiece was further reduced. Thus, punching performance could be improved by reducing the relative size of the flyer to the mold diameter. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Flyer impact; High-speed punching; Laser-accelerated flyer; Microscale punching","Molds; Failure characteristics; Flyer impact; Forming pressure; High Speed; High speed impact; Manufacturing process; Micro-scale; Pressure transfer; Punching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047433773

For this purpose, a viscoelastic analysis was derived for the viscoelastic multilayered pavement systems under a moving load and used for integrating the multiaxial VECD model into the developed solution. Because of the analytical nature of the algorithm, stiffness reduction by means of pseudo stiffness could be directly evaluated at any location and at any loading repetition over a three-dimensional pavement structure.

This study identifies the correlation between the WQI and individual perceptions regarding stream restoration. Regional context and individual characteristics also influence the demands and awareness of citizens pertaining to stream restoration. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding residents' perceptions and demographic information, including education, marriage status, gender, and residence period in different subwatersheds. The largest change (28.29) in the WQI score of one subwatershed was correlated with the participants' perception of water quality changes and water pollution (analytical hierarchy process index: 66.8%).

Structural and optical investigations showed that Eu3+ was successfully doped in the PVDF NFs and it induced discrete emissions corresponding to the electronic transitions. As the Eu content increased, the phase transformation was enhanced from the α-phase to the β-phase in the PVDF NFs, and their diameter decreased. These changes enhanced the electrical output power of the TENGs. However, the further addition of Eu resulted in precipitation of the NO3−-related complex on the surface of the PVDF NFs, which was detrimental to performance of the TENGs.

However, for the coloration efficiency (CE), the FTO films with the optimum sheet resistance of ~6 Ω/□ exhibited the highest value as compared to the other samples. The improvement of the CE value can be mainly attributed to high transmittance modulation by the uniform surface morphology of the FTO films to reduce interfacial light-scattering between the WO3 films and FTO films. Therefore, our results provide a valuable insight into the improvement of the performance of the EC devices using the optimum sheet resistance (~6 Ω/□) of the FTO films. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Electrical properties; Electrochromic performances; Films; Optical properties; Transition metal oxides","Conductive films; Deposition; Electric properties; Electrochromic devices; Electrochromism; Films; Fluorine; Light scattering; Nanocomposites; Optical properties; Sheet resistance; Spray pyrolysis; Tin; Tin compounds; Tin oxides; Transition metal compounds; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Transparent conducting oxides; Transparent electrodes; Tungsten compounds; Coloration efficiencies; Electrochemical activities; Electrochromic performance; Fluorine doped tin oxide; Fluorine-doped tin oxide films; High transmittance; Transparent conducting electrodes; Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis; Oxide films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042357714

Due to the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), there are many areas in IoT application where WSN applications are found. These applications generally impose severe constraints on the lifetime of the WSN, which is expected to last several years. It is necessary to diminish the overall energy consumption of the sensor node and to find an additional source of energy for achieving this objective. On the other hand, due to the imminent crisis of the radio frequency spectrum, light fidelity (LiFi) offers many key benefits and effective solutions for these issues that have been postured in the most recent decade. In this paper, we propose a novel EH-HL model for future smart homes and industries based on the integration of energy harvesting WSN (EH-WSN) and hybrid LiFi/WiFi communication techniques. The proposed model is capable of efficiently transmitting data at high speed for bidirectional multidevice and by harvesting energy, we provide the power to the sensor nodes. To synchronize multidevice transmissions, transmit data and provide low-cost wireless communication, we used the color beams of the red, green, and blue LEDs. The result of the evaluation shows that the hybrid communication scheme is proposed in the EH-HL model. It also offers superior performance and achieves a data rate of 25 Mb/s for multiaccess/multiusers. © 2018 IEEE.","Energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EH-WSN); Internet of Things (IoT); light fidelity (LiFi); smart home; smart industry; WiFi","Automation; Energy utilization; Home networks; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Modulation; Sensor nodes; Wi-Fi; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication techniques; Effective communication; Image color analysis; Internet of Things (IOT); LiFi; Radio frequency spectrum; Smart homes; Wireless communications; Energy harvesting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041363657

With the increasing amount of users on Facebook, the probability of broadcasting spam content on it is also escalating day by day. There are a few existing techniques to combat spam on Facebook. However, due to the public unavailability of critical pieces of Facebook information, like profiles, network information, an unlimited number of posts and more, the existing techniques do not work efficiently for detecting many spammers. In this paper, we propose an efficient spammer detection framework (we called as SpamSpotter) that distinguishes spammers from legitimate users on Facebook. Based on Facebook's recent characteristics, the framework introduces a novel feature set to facilitate spammer detection. We use a baseline dataset from Facebook that included 300 spammers and 700 legitimate user profiles. The baseline dataset contains a set of features for each profile, which are extracted using a novel dataset construction mechanism. In addition, an intelligent decision support system that uses eight different machine learning classifiers on the baseline dataset is designed to distinguish spammers from legitimate users. To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed framework, we implemented and compared it with existing frameworks. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed framework is accurate and efficient to deliver first-rate performance.

To address this problem, a robust control scheme of grid-connected inverters is presented in this paper. The proposed scheme is achieved by an internal model (IM)-based current controller and a robust phase-locked loop (PLL) scheme. The robust PLL scheme employs open-loop filtering technique to offer exact steady-state performance as well as fast transient response. The IM-based current controller is stabilized using the linear matrix inequality approach to optimize the feedback gains, and implemented in the synchronous reference frame to reduce computational efforts. A state estimator is also introduced into current controller for the purpose of reducing the number of current sensors, which are often required in state feedback controller to damp the unstable dynamics of LCL filters.

Specifically, Wilson 's regulatory politics model is used to explain the relationship between regulation and innovation, which is regarded as the biggest obstacle to digital innovation. In order to review the deregulation politics model, we analyze the cases of taxi call service (Uber-Kakao taxi). As a result of analysis, Uber service, which creates conflicts with existing providers during the initial introduction of new services, has failed to enter the initial market. However, the process of introducing these new services is not a one-time and static process, but it can be seen that the changes in the policy environment and the actor's interaction with the changes in time affect the influence of the regulatory system and the entry of new businesses into the market. Uber's failure has become a culmination of market entry and business success with the transformation of the business model. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Digital innovation; Kakao Taxi; O2O; Regulatory policy; Technology innovation; Uber; Wilson's regulatory politics model","Commerce; Taxicabs; Digital innovations; Kakao Taxi; Regulatory policies; Technology innovation; Uber; Public policy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049017984

The IC50 values for OAinduced cytotoxicity were 112.57 in DU145, 132.29 in MCF-7, and 163.60 in U87 cells, respectively. OA did not exhibit toxicity in BNL CL. 2 and Hs 68 cell lines in our experiments.

This enhanced apoptosis was due to increases in p53, cytochrome c, Bax, PARP-1 and caspase-3 expression in DU145, MCF-7 and U87 cell lines. OA-treated DU145 cells were arrested in G2 because of the activation of p-AKT, p-JNK, p21 and p27, and the decrease in p-ERK, cyclin B1 and CDK2 expression; OA-treated MCF-7 cells were arrested in G1 owing to the activation of p-JNK, p-ERK, p21, and p27, and the decrease in p-AKT, cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2; and OA-treated U87 cells also exhibited G1 phase arrest caused by the increase in p-ERK, p-JNK, p-AKT, p21, and p27, and the decrease in cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2.

Further, the studies focus on the buffer replacement policy, overlooking the more fundamental question of whether to use the buffer as read/write or write-only buffer. This paper compares the performance of the two buffer types in an SSD environment with internal parallelism using block I/O traces of representative servers and finds the followings. i) Even if the buffer replacement policy is the same, the average response time differs by up to 29.8% depending on the buffer type. Overall, the read/ write buffer has a shorter average response time due to a higher buffer hit ratio. ii) However, despite a low buffer hit ratio, the average response time of read requests is reduced by up to 82.5% in the write-only buffer. This is because the read misses are handled bypassing the buffers in the write-only buffers, and thus there is no need to wait until the victim dirty buffer is flushed. iii) The response time is mainly determined by the waiting time, and the long waiting time occurs when evicting a dirty buffer. Therefore, when designing a buffer management policy, it should be considered to flush the tail dirty buffers in advance. © IEICE 2018.","Buffer management; Internal parallelism; NAND flash memory; Read/write buffer; Solid state drives; Write-only buffer","Cache memory; Memory architecture; NAND circuits; Random access storage; Buffer management; Internal parallelism; NAND flash memory; Read/write buffer; Solid state drives; Write-only buffer; Flash-based SSDs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053634035

This increases particulate matter (PM) emissions, as coal emits 6 to 55 times more PM than NG in the course of power generation. Increased PM concentration causes visibility impairment and acute respiratory diseases. Thus, the South Korean government is seeking to shift from coal to NG power generation for the purpose of abating PM emissions. The government also considers NG as a bridge energy to facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This article attempts to answer the question, ""Do people place significant value on shifting from coal to NG power generation in order to abate PM?"" To this end, additional willingness to pay (WTP) for NG over coal for electricity for the purpose of PM emissions abatement was assessed from 1000 South Koreans' contingent valuations (CV). More specifically, each of these randomly chosen interviewees was asked about her/his WTP for the switch from coal to NG for 1 kWh of electricity use. The average additional WTP estimate was KRW 31.27 (USD 0.028) per kWh, which is equivalent to 28.8% of the average price of electricity in 2017. Moreover, this estimate is statistically significant. The generation cost of NG is about KRW100.13 per kWh, which is higher than that of coal (KRW78.5 per kWh). The gap is KRW22.08 per kWh, which is less than the additional WTP. Thus, it is obvious that the governmental policy of shifting from coal to NG for power generation in order to abate PM emissions is supported by the public and, hence, the shift should be made gradually. © 2018 by the authors.","Coal; Contingent valuation; Natural gas; Particulate matter; Power generation; Shift; Willingness to pay","abatement cost; alternative energy; coal; concentration (composition); contingent valuation; cost analysis; governance approach; natural gas; particulate matter; power generation; respiratory disease; willingness to pay; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047548480

The technology can be realized by a disordered plasmonic nanostructure composed of a transferred metal nanoparticle–UC nanocrystals (UCNC)–metal (tMUM) film using the graphene transfer process, in which the metal nanoparticles that formed on the graphene layer are transferred using Scotch tape. The plasmonic tMUM film strongly enhances the UCL by a factor of 200 mainly because of the excitation of the gap plasmon polaritons. Meanwhile, the UCNCs in direct contact with the metal film result in luminescence quenching caused by a nonradiative process. Herein, a highly secure anti-counterfeit film is developed, which is very hard to duplicate and cannot be reused, using two conflicting features (i.e., emission enhancement and quenching phenomena). The UCL is strongly amplified only when the first (i.e., a random metal nanoparticle array) and second (i.e., UCNCs on a Ag film) codes are very precisely overlapped as designed, thereby generating the originally designed final code. Therefore, our novel high-level security device is expected to be easily applied to protect and identify genuine products. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Even though EGaIn liquid metal is generally known to have low toxicity, the toxicity of the metal, rather than a salt form of Ga or In, has not been systematically studied yet. In this paper, we investigate the time-dependent concentration of the ions released from EGaIn liquid metal in an aqueous environment and their cytotoxicity to human cells. It is observed that only the Ga ion is dominantly released from EGaIn when no external agitation is applied, whereas the concentration of the In ion drastically increases with sonication. The cytotoxicity study reveals that all human cells tested are viable in the growth media with naturally released EGaIn ions, but the cytotoxicity becomes significant with sonication-induced EGaIn releasates. On the basis of the comparative study with other representative toxic elements, that is, Hg and Cd, it could be concluded that EGaIn is reasonably safe to use in an aqueous environment; however, it should be cautiously handled when any mechanical agitation is applied.

However, it remains a critical limiting factor to the more widespread use of MBR for wastewater treatment. The concept of quorum sensing (QS) / quorum quenching (QQ) was proposed as an anti-fouling strategy for MBRs in 2002 and the first paper on that issue was published in 2009. Since then, many studies have demonstrated and proved the potential of QQ for biofouling control in MBR through various means. The evolution of QQ-MBR has had a run of eight years in terms of QQ-microorganisms, QQ-media, and the size of the QQ-MBRs tested. This review provides an overview on the QS/QQ studies related to the elucidation and control of biofouling in MBRs, including the identification of QS signals, the isolation of QS signal producing or degrading microorganisms, and various engineering approaches to apply enzymatic or bacterial QQ in the form of QQ-media to mitigate membrane biofouling.

Therefore, the government aims to make zero energy buildings mandatory from 2025, onward. For the housing sector, the government has recently built and operated a pilot net-zero energy apartment (NZEA) and plans to expand it to several cities. This article attempts to obtain information about the consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the NZEAs. To this end, households' additional WTP for the NZEAs over a conventional apartment was investigated, applying the contingent valuation (CV) approach. The data on the WTP were gathered from a CV survey of 1000 interviewees and analyzed, employing a dichotomous choice question and the spike model, respectively. The mean value of the additional WTP is obtained as KRW0.46 million (USD 424) perm2, which is statistically significant. This value corresponds to 17.0% of the conventional apartment price per m2 (KRW2.76 million, USD 2436). It can be concluded that the households in South Korea place a significant value on a NZEA over a conventional apartment. In addition, we have investigated the characteristics of consumers which affect the probability that consumers accept additional payment of an amount of money for NZEA over a conventional apartment, finding that higher income earners, higher education, and male consumers have a higher probability. © 2018 by the authors.","Contingent valuation; Net-zero energy apartment; Willingness to pay","balance of payments; building; contingent valuation; emission; environmental economics; governance approach; greenhouse gas; price dynamics; questionnaire survey; willingness to pay; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046997834

This value can be calculated using structural characteristics of the track system and each of the track components. In addition, the track impact factor(TIF) is a key parameter of design considering the influence of dynamic load, which changes according to the train speed. This value can be calculated by probabilistic analysis of the dynamic wheel load fluctuation rate that is tested on railway track. The track impact factor is affected by the track support stiffness, rail surface irregularities, and void sleepers. These individual factors vary according to the track structure. In this study, the dynamic variables of track structures are obtained by field testing, and the TSS and TIF of each track system are calculated through numerical and probabilistic analysis. Based on tests and theoretical (design) analysis of TSS and TIF for ballast and concrete track system, it was found that there is a linear relationship between TSS and TIF, and the difference of TSS and TIF for each track system is large. The results show that it is appropriate to apply a separate design standard of track support stiffness and track impact factor for ballast and concrete track structures. © 2018 The Korean Society for Railway.

The results of this study are summarized as follows. First, the effects of job anxiety perceived by employees on organizational commitment and safety behaviors were investigated by hierarchical regression analysis. As a result of the hypothesis test, it was found that the employment anxiety does not have much meaning to promote organizational commitment, but it helps to strengthen safety behavior. This is due to the use of convenience samples to select the sample. The results of this study suggest that to induce or strengthen safety behaviors and prevent the safety accidents of PSD maintenance workers, it is urgent to eliminate employment anxiety. Especially, safety work that is directly connected with the safety of citizens does not take publicity. It can be grounds for the need for employment security. However, due to the nature of the sample, it may be difficult to generalize the empirical analysis results to all irregular workers. © 2018 The Korean Society for Railway.

Therefore, concrete compressive strength, girder height, girder length and unbonded tendon length were selected as design parameters that relate to girder deflection. In addition, a tendon layout was also considered as a design parameter to control top stress of pretension girder section at support. Analysis results show that both girder height and length are dominant design parameters governing girder deflection, in comparison to compressive strength and debonded tendon length. The design weight value is suggested by sensitivity analysis. In terms of stress, sufficient length of debonded tendon to satisfy the debonded tendon rule, and efficient tendon layout, are recommended to minimize deflection at mid-span and section top stress at support. © 2018 The Korean Society for Railway.

Results of the study show that decreased curvature radius, increased vehicle speed, and increased rail wear lead to an increase in the derailment coefficient of the vehicle.

In order to formulate the factorization near threshold in SCET, we should include an additional degree of freedom with small energy, collinear to the beam direction. The corresponding collinear-soft mode is included to describe the parton distribution function (PDF) near threshold. The soft function is modified by subtracting the contribution of the collinear-soft modes in order to avoid double counting on the overlap region. As a result, the proper soft function becomes infrared finite, and all the factorized parts are free of rapidity divergence. Furthermore, the separation of the relevant scales in each factorized part becomes manifest. We apply the same idea to the dihadron production in e+e- annihilation near threshold, and show that the resultant soft function is also free of infrared and rapidity divergences. © 2018 authors.

XPS analyses reveal that the native oxides on the GaN surface are reduced significantly during the early ALD stage, indicating that AlN deposition effectively clelans up the GaN surface. In addition, the suppression of Al-OH bonds is observed through the ALD process. This result may be related to the improved device performance because Al-OH bonds act as interface defects. Finally, temperature dependent I-V analyses show that the barrier height increases and the ideality factor decreases with an increase in temperature, which is associated with the barrier inhomogeneity.

The cooling air was tangentially injected against rotor spinning into the inlet mixing zone of the test GFB. The hollow rotor was heated by a cartridge heater. The GFB temperatures were measured at intervals of 30 deg along the circumference of the axial center except for at 45 deg, where the cooling flow is injected. The rotor temperatures were measured near the GFB side ends using an infrared thermometer, which was calibrated with a thermocouple. Load cells measure the static load and bearing torque. The baseline rotor temperature was measured without GFB over the axial length at rotor speeds up to 15 krpm and for increasing heater temperatures up to 400 °C. The results showed relatively uniform rotor temperatures at the test journal GFB section, and severe heat convections on the rotor surfaces. The GFB and rotor temperatures were measured under a static load of 80 N for increasing heater temperatures of 100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C and 400 °C and with increasing cooling flow rates of 100 liter/min, 150 liter/min, and 200 liter/min. The circumferential GFB temperatures showed the maximum temperatures at the loaded zone and the minimum temperatures in the unloaded zone. The increasing cooling flow effectively reduced both the rotor and GFB temperatures, showing a dramatic decrease with the smallest amount of cooling flow. GFB friction torque was measured for two test cases for the static load of 80 N at a rotor speed of 10 krpm: 1) A lift-off and touch-down operating cycle for increasing heater temperatures without the cooling flow, and 2) a continuous operation for the heater temperature of 400 °C with increasing cooling flows. In test case 1, the GFB friction torque decreased for higher heater temperatures due to a larger thermal expansion of the bearing housing than the rotor’s. In test case 2, the GFB friction torque decreased with increasing cooling flows due to strong cooling effects on the rotor temperature. The results imply that the tangential air injection increased the GFB clearance by directly cooling the rotor and effectively alleviating the rotor expansion; hence, the scheme is capable of an effective cooling for high temperature GFB applications, such as micro gas turbines. © 2018, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bearing friction; Cooling flow; Gas foil bearing; Hot rotor","Cooling; Foil bearings; Friction; Gas turbines; High temperature applications; Testing; Thermal expansion; Thermocouples; Torque; Tribology; Bearing friction; Continuous operation; Cooling flows; Gas foil bearing; Infrared thermometers; Maximum temperature; Minimum temperatures; Thermal Performance; Rotors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046887976

In metal grid electrodes, various shapes of grid patterns were used to avoid the moiré phenomenon. In this study, we investigated the effects of the metal grid shapes - such as the honeycomb, diamond, and square - on the flexibility and durability of the metal grid film using an experimental and numerical analysis. The flexibility of the metal grid film was evaluated via the following: bending, cyclic bending fatigue and stretching tests; it was compared with the numerical stress analysis. In the bending test, the resistance of the honeycomb grid sample increased by 10% at a bending radius of 10 mm. On the other hand, the diamond grid showed almost no change in resistance up to a bending radius of 6 mm. When the substrate was stretched to 5%, many cracks appeared on the surface of the honeycomb pattern sample. On the other hand, no cracks were found in the diamond pattern sample. Therefore, the diamond pattern exhibited superior flexibility and durability to the honeycomb pattern. The numerical stress analysis also showed that the honeycomb pattern had the highest stress and the diamond pattern had the lowest stress during bending and stretching, which corresponded with the experimental results. © 2018 Korean Society for Precision Engineeing.

Since effective passive measures eventually reduce the heating and cooling loads, thus also reducing the system size, passive and hybrid measures are the most preferred Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs). In addition, the domestic situation and climate are additional constraints in energy retrofit decision making, such as a shorter budget and time, poor maintenance history, and uncertainties in vernacular lifestyle. For this reason, the performance improvement and side-effects prior to installing ECMs should be predictable, particularly in case the originality can be damaged. This complexity confirms that simulation-based Measurement and Verification (M & V) would better suit the energy retrofit of domestic historic buildings. However, many domestic investors still believe re-construction has a larger economic value than restoration. Therefore, they are even unwilling to invest in more time than a preset audit period-typically less than a week. Although simulation-based M & V is theoretically favored for retrofit decision making, its process including collecting data, modeling and analysis, and evaluating and designing ECMs could still be too demanding to domestic practitioners. While some manual, repetitive, error-prone works exist in the conventional retrofit process and simulation-based M & V, it is proposed here that enhanced Building Information Technology (BIT) is able to simplify, automate, and objectify, at least the critical steps of the retrofit project. The aim of this study is to find an efficient and effective energy retrofit strategy for domestic historic buildings that appeals to both domestic investors and practitioners by testing selective BIT tools on an actual historic building. This study concludes with the suggestion that software vendors are asked to develop enhanced features to resolve users' pending demands. It is also suggested that, in the domestic context, how the current practice for each process of the energy retrofit of historic buildings needs to shift to take a full advantage of BIT. © 2018 by the authors.","BIM; Energy retrofit; Historic building; Measurement & Verification; Simulation","cooling; decision making; energy; heating; historic building; information technology; performance assessment; simulation; software; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046102399

Therefore, it is necessary to consider the impact of climate change on flood when establishing sustainable water resources management policy. In order to predict the future flood events, the frequency analysis is commonly applied. Traditional methods for flood frequency analysis are based on the assumption of stationarity, which is questionable under the climate change, although many techniques that are based on stationarity have been developed. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and compare all of the corresponding effects of three different data sets (observed, RCP 4.5, and 8.5), two different frequency models (stationary and non-stationary), and two different frequency analysis procedures (rainfall frequency first approach and direct discharge approach). As a result, the design flood from the observed data by the stationary frequency model and rainfall frequency first approach can be concluded the most reasonable. Thus, the design flood from the RCP 8.5 by the non-stationary frequency model and rainfall frequency first approach should be carefully used for the establishment of flood prevention measure while considering climate change and uncertainty. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Flood frequency analysis; Non-stationarity; Uncertainty","climate change; design flood; flood control; flood frequency; global climate; resource management; uncertainty analysis; water resource; watershed; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046101960

Mushroom-shaped biofilm structures, which are reported for many bacteria, exhibit topographically varying levels of multiple drug resistance from the cap of the mushroom to its stalk. Understanding the dynamics behind the formation of such structures can aid in design of drug delivery systems, antibiotics, or physical systems for removal of biofilms. We explored the development of metabolically heterogeneous Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms using numerical models and laboratory knockout experiments on wild-type and chemotaxis-deficient mutants. We show that chemotactic processes dominate the transformation of slender and hemispherical structures into mushroom structures with a signature cap. Cellular Potts model simulation and experimental data provide evidence that accelerated movement of bacteria along the periphery of the biofilm, due to nutrient cues, results in the formation of mushroom structures and bacterial segregation. Multidrug resistance of bacteria is one of the most threatening dangers to public health. Understanding the mechanisms of the development of mushroom-shaped biofilms helps to identify the multidrug-resistant regions. We decoded the dynamics of the structural evolution of bacterial biofilms and the physics behind the formation of biofilm structures as well as the biological triggers that produce them. Combining in vitro gene knockout experiments with in silico models showed that chemotactic motility is one of the main driving forces for the formation of stalks and caps.

In particular, this paper investigates a manufacturer's retailing channel strategy considering the relative market power between a manufacturer and a retailer in the supply chain, which has been rarely considered in previous studies. This paper shows the manufacturer's channel strategies: (i) if customers are very heterogeneous with regard to their receptiveness to online shopping, the manufacturer may use a multi-channel strategy. (ii) if the customer sector becomes homogeneous, the manufacturer will become more willing to adopt an omni-channel strategy. (iii) if customers are neither similar nor very different, the manufacturer uses a brick-and-mortar strategy. This paper also shows results on the issue of channel conflict in terms of market power: (i) the retailer may voluntarily limit its market power and thus, self-created competition in the retail market alleviates the problem of double-markup to some extent. (ii) the manufacturer can use an online channel when inter-competition effect becomes severe. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Channel conflict; Channel management strategies; Inter-competition; Intra-cannibalization; Omni-channel model; Pricing strategies; Supply chain","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Mobile devices; Sales; Supply chains; Channel conflict; Channel management; Channel model; Intra-cannibalization; Pricing strategy; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044510773

Given such enhancement of Internet of knowledge on SNS, the probability of spreading spammers on it is also increasing day by day. Several traditional machine-learning methods, such as support vector machines and naïve Bayes, have been proposed to detect spammers on SNS. Note, however, that these methods are not efficient due to some issues, such as lower generalization performance and higher training time. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an efficient classification method that can provide good generalization performance at higher training speed. Nonetheless, it suffers from overfitting and ill-posed problem that can degrade its generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a Bagging ELM-based spammer detection framework that identifies spammers in SNSs with the help of multiple ELMs that we combined using the bagging method. We constructed a labeled dataset of the two most prominent SNSs – Twitter and Facebook – to evaluate the performance of our framework. The evaluation results show that our framework obtained higher generalization performance rate of 99.01% for the Twitter dataset and 99.02% for the Facebook datasets, while required a lower training time of 1.17 s and 1.10s, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bagging method; Extreme learning machine; Internet of knowledge; Machine learning; Social networking services; Spammer detection","Artificial intelligence; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Bagging method; Classification methods; Extreme learning machine; Generalization performance; Knowledge protection; Machine learning methods; Social networking services; Spammer detections; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044130214

The optical band gap energy and abnormal electronic transition in the CoAl-based LDH were determined for the first time. The band gap energy decreased when increasing the Co3+ ion content in the LDHs in the range of 2.64–3.06 eV.

In the design and fabrication of the MPHE, a transparent acrylic plate was attached to the stainless steel plate on which 14 parallel rectangular channels were formed. As working fluids, FC-72 and ethanol were tested. The fluid inside the micro channel moves rapidly with pulsating motions by swelling and shrinking of liquid slug/gas plug at evaporation and condensation sections. By measuring the temperature variations from start-up to steady state operation, the effective thermal conductivities were evaluated. Since the filling ratio of working fluid plays an important role in heat exchanger efficiency, the optimum filling ratio was found for each working fluid. From the flow visualization inside the MPHE filled with FC-72, two different flow modes – oscillatory eruption mode and circulation mode – occurs according to the filling ratio. The circulating motion which occurs at the optimum filling ratio, helps the heat transfer into the cooling water more active than the oscillatory eruption mode. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Asymmetric pulsating heat exchanger; Flow visualization; Optimum filling ratio; Thermal oscillation","Cooling water; Filling; Flow visualization; Heat transfer; Oscillating flow; Thermal conductivity; Working fluids; Effective thermal conductivity; Evaporation and condensation; Filling ratio; Heat exchanger efficiency; Stainless steel plate; Steady-state operation; Temperature variation; Thermal oscillations; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039743864

Given that the average price of the mineral water (500 mL) in non-UBC was KRW 1000 (USD 0.88), the mean additional WTP a premium for that in UBC was estimated to be KRW 107 (USD 0.09).

The ultimate goal is to implement it as though a VR user freely exists in a place. To this end, it is most important to reconstruct a VR space that provides six degree-of-freedom (DOF), namely, yaw, pitch, roll, surge, sway, and heave. However, most currently released VR services that are based on the real world limit users' movements to three DOF. Even if the services support six DOF, most are highly complex and based on computer graphics. To overcome this problem, we first assume that there is a full Internet of things (IoT) infrastructure for collecting important data for VR space reconstruction. This assumption is realistic because many researchers expect that in the near future, IoT technology will lead to a world that connects not only people to people but also things to things. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system architecture for the VR space that is based on the real world along with the element technologies that constitute the proposed system.

Nonetheless, the relevant technology is still in a premature research stage mainly due to the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites that ceaselessly cause unwanted side reactions with electrolyte. In order to circumvent this shortcoming, herein, an ionic liquid additive, namely, 1-dodecyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium (Pyr1(12)+) bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI−), for conventional electrolyte solutions is reported. The Pyr1(12)+ cation with a long aliphatic chain mitigates dendrite growth via the combined effects of electrostatic shielding and lithiophobicity, whereas the FSI− anion can induce the formation of rigid solid–electrolyte interphase layers. The synergy between the cation and anion significantly improves cycling performance in asymmetric and symmetric control cells and a full cell paired with an LiFePO4 cathode.

The objective of this study is to suggest the graphical bilinear method to estimate soil depth through seismic wave velocity. Seismic wave velocity rapidly changes at the interface of two different layers due to the change in material type, packing type, and contact force of particles and thus, it is possible to pick the soil depth based on seismic wave velocity. An area, which is susceptible to debris flow, was selected, and an aerial survey was performed to obtain a topographic map and digital elevation model. In addition, a seismic survey and a dynamic cone penetration test were performed in this study. The comparison between the soil depth based on dynamic cone tests and the graphical bilinear method shows good agreement, indicating that the newly suggested soil depth estimating method may be usefully applied to predict soil depth. © 2018 by the authors.","Dynamic cone penetration test; Graphical bilinear method; Seismic survey; Soil depth; Time-distance curve",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045379062

The advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have made it possible to regenerate such damaged organs or tissues into functional organ or tissue with the help of 3D bioprinting. The main component of the 3D bioprinting is the bioink, which is crucial for the development of functional organs or tissue structures. The bioinks used in 3D printing technology require so many properties which are vital and need to be considered during the selection. Combination of different methods and enhancements in properties are required to develop more successful bioinks for the 3D printing of organs or tissue structures. Main body: This review consists of the recent state-of-art of polymer-based bioinks used in 3D printing for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The subsection projects the basic requirements for the selection of successful bioinks for 3D printing and developing 3D tissues or organ structures using combinations of bioinks such as cells, biomedical polymers and biosignals. Different bioink materials and their properties related to the biocompatibility, printability, mechanical properties, which are recently reported for 3D printing are discussed in detail. Conclusion: Many bioinks formulations have been reported from cell-biomaterials based bioinks to cell-based bioinks such as cell aggregates and tissue spheroids for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Interestingly, more tunable bioinks, which are biocompatible for live cells, printable and mechanically stable after printing are emerging with the help of functional polymeric biomaterials, their modifications and blending of cells and hydrogels. These approaches show the immense potential of these bioinks to produce more complex tissue/organ structures using 3D bioprinting in the future. © 2018 The Author(s).","3D printing; Bioink; Biomaterials; Regenerative medicine; Tissue engineering","agarose; alginic acid; bioink; cellulose; collagen; fibrin; hyaluronic acid; ink; polymer; silk; unclassified drug; biocompatibility; biomechanics; bioprinting; extracellular matrix; priority journal; regenerative medicine; Review; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue structure; trend study",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044985374

The paved all-quadrilateral mesh covering the entire domain is cut by the boundaries of a geometric surface. Pentagonal shell elements are created by cutting the corners of quadrilateral shell elements at the domain boundaries. Pentagonal shape functions are constructed using Wachspress coordinates, and assumed natural strains in the form of the mixed interpolation of tensorial components approach are employed to avoid the transverse shear locking of pentagonal shell elements.

A systematic way to define a reference state for the given torque reference is provided. The reference state is determined according to the operational modes to yield the highest possible efficiency. Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operation is adopted considering Ohmic loss minimization below and above the base speed. MTPA in field-weakening region is adopted. In the proposed CCS-MPC, a cost index is defined using the derived reference state and the optimal control input is determined considering the input constraints. The proposed control method is implemented and validated by simulation and experimental studies. The results confirm that the proposed approach gives a very good dynamic performance overall speed with minimal torque and current ripples. © 2017 IEEE.","continuous control set MPC; field-weakening; Induction motors; torque control","Induction motors; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Propulsion; Torque; Continuous control; Dynamic performance; Field-weakening; Input constraints; Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operations; Operational modes; Optimal controls; Wide speed range; Torque control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048786330

However, evaluation system for the in-wheel vehicles is not well established, the absence of the evaluation system for in-wheel vehicles is one of the major obstacles to commercialization of the in-wheel vehicles. In this study, we have suggested a new methodology of dynamometer test for in-wheel vehicle and devised simulators that can analyze the performance of in-wheel vehicles. In general, a new vehicle goes through the performance evaluation on dynamometer test which can simulate a straight motion of vehicles. Due to the characteristics of dynamometer test which simulates only a straight motion, it is not suitable for test for in-wheel vehicle. In the case of in-wheel vehicle, since driving motors on wheels are controlled independently, the stability of in-wheel vehicles during turning is important. Therefore, we have developed an in-wheel vehicle simulator to build a dynamometer test which can simulate turning motions of in-wheel vehicle. Using CarSim & Matlab/Simulink, we realized dynamic motion of a vehicle on a curved 3-demensional road. With this simulator, we could extract the load torque of each wheel during driving on the 3D virtual road. If the derived load torque is applied to motors of dynamometer test, it is possible to simulate driving on real road, through which the performance and the efficiency of in-wheel vehicles can be analyzed before the actual vehicle experiment. Also, we developed another simulator to evaluate the performance and the efficiency of in-wheel vehicles. This simulator allows us to evaluate the performance of in-wheel vehicles by using load torque derived from previous simulator. In this study, we developed two types of simulators to evaluate the performance of in-wheel vehicles in the simulation environment where the load torque for each wheel is different. One simulator derives load torque of each wheel and the other simulator evaluates the performance of in-wheel vehicles. © 2018, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","3-D road; Driving performance; Dynamometer test; In-wheel vehicle; Load torque","Automobile drivers; Dynamometers; Internal combustion engines; MATLAB; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Roads and streets; Simulators; Testing; Torque; Torque measurement; Vehicle performance; 3-D road; Driving performance; In-wheel; Load torques; Performance evaluations; Simulation environment; Vehicle experiment; Vehicle simulators; Vehicle wheels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051055856

Although the pulse sequence and duration are the same, aspects of the film growth rate, microstructure, crystallinity, and electrical resistivity are quite different according to the reactive gas. Crystallized and relatively conductive film with a higher growth rate is acquired using NH3 as a reactive gas while amorphous and resistive film with a lower growth rate is achieved using N2+H2 mixed gas. To examine the relationship between the chemical properties and resistivity of the film, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted on the ALD-grown TaNx film with N2+H2 mixed gas, NH3, and H2. For a comparison, reactive sputter-grown TaNx film with N2 is also studied. The results reveal that ALD-grown TaNx films with NH3 and H2 include a metallic Ta-N bond, which results in the film's higher conductivity. Meanwhile, ALD-grown TaNx film with a N2+H2 mixed gas or sputtergrown TaNx film with N2 gas mainly contains a semiconducting Ta3N5 bond.

In particular, τ50 of the aglycone fraction exhibited a higher cellular protective effect than that of (+)-α-tocopherol (37.7 min). The cell viability of the ethyl acetate fraction on the UVB-induced cell damage increased up to 90.1%. In addition, the ethyl acetate fraction (5-25 µg/mL) showed cellular protective effects on the H2O2-induced cell damages in a dose-dependent manner. TLC, HPLC, UV-vis spectroscopy and LC-MS were used to analyse components of the ethyl acetate fraction and the main components were quercetin, kaempferol and their glycosides.

The barrier height increased with increasing temperature, but the ideality factor decreased. Increases in temperature are associated with barrier inhomogeneity. The modified Richardson plots for Al0.25Ga0.75N yielded a higher Richardson constant, 77.3 A cm−2K−2, than theoretically predicted (30.0 A cm−2 K−2). This indicates that the thermionic emission (TE) model with barrier inhomogeneity is not suitable for explaining the transport characteristics of the junction. We fitted the experimental I–V data to predictions based on various transport mechanisms, such as TE, generation-recombination, and tunneling currents.

Both La- and Ce-doped Ca122 single crystals show a very broad superconducting transition width (ΔT c) due to their non-bulk nature. Surprisingly, ΔT c becomes sharper or broader after an electric current larger than a threshold value (I t) is applied, with a concomitant change in the normal-state magnetism. The sharpened (broadened) ΔT c is accompanied by a decrease (an increase) in the amplitude of the ferromagnetic signals. The sensitive changes in the superconductivity and magnetism that occur when an external current is applied are related to the inhomogeneous electronic states that originate from the Fe magnetic state and/or self-organized superconducting/magnetic composites in Ca122 compounds. These discoveries shed new light on the role of Fe in Fe-based superconductors and will provide new ideas for the design of novel superconducting devices. © The Author(s) 2018.",,"Calcium compounds; Iron compounds; Magnetism; Rare earth compounds; Rare earths; Single crystals; Superconducting devices; External currents; Ferromagnetic signals; Inhomogeneous superconductivity; Rare earth doped; Super conducting phasis; Superconducting transition width; Superconductivity and magnetism; Threshold-value; Iron-based Superconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045189689

The 6×Histidine-tag site which has been widely used in purification of a recombinant protein was introduced at the N-terminus of amicyanin to make the complex of 6×His-tagged plus cobalt functioning as a newly derived redox cofactor in amicyanin. In this study, Pro94 of amicyanin was substituted to Ala and Phe to tune up the midpoint potential (Em) value of amicyanin 100 mV more positive and then intra-electron transfer rates were measured to examine whether the Em value of the type 1 copper site in amicyanin affects intraprotein electron transfer or not. By the addition of H2O2, the Co2+-loaded 6×His-tagged site was activated, and then electron was transferred from Cu1+ of type 1 copper site of amicyanin to Co3+ plus 6×His-tagged site. Electron transfer rates of cobalt loaded P94A and F amicyanin were much slower than that of native amicyanin.

We propose a single channel capacitive proximity pressure sensor (TCPS) and gait monitoring system for smart healthcare. Insole-type TCPS (270 mm in length) was designed consisting of three layers including two shield layers and a sensor layer. Analyzing the step count and stride time are the basic indicators in gait analysis, thus they were selected as evaluation indicators. A total of 12 subjects participated in the experiment to evaluate the resolution of our TCPS. To evaluate the accuracy of TCPS, step count and its error rates were simultaneously detected by naked eye, ZIKTO Walk (ZIKTO Co., Korea), and HJ-203-K pedometer (Omron Co., Japan) as reference. Results showed that the error rate of 1.77% in TCPS was lower than those of other devices and correlation coefficient was 0.958 (p-value = 0.000). ZIKTO Walk and pedometer do not provide information on stride time, therefore it was detected by F-scan (Tekscan, USA) to evaluate the performance of TCPS. As a result, error rate of stride time measured by TCPS was found to be 1% and the correlation coefficient was 0.685 (p-value = 0.000).

Therefore, lattice-based cryptography has been proposed as a new public key cryptography to replace them. The Ring-LWE scheme has been proposed to implement lattice-based cryptography. To apply the scheme to IoT devices using 8-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit microcontrollers, optimization is inevitable. Further, the 8-bit environment is more important for small IoT devices.

Antibacterial susceptibility screening demonstrated that erythorbyl laurate exerted both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on gram-positive foodborne pathogens (minimum inhibitory concentration: 0.48–0.88 mM, minimum bactericidal concentration: 0.65–1.00 mM). The growth curves of gram-positive strains showed increases in the λ (lag phase) accompanied by decreases in the μmax (maximum specific growth rate) as the concentration of erythorbyl laurate increased. The results of the crystal violet uptake and LIVE/DEAD BacLight assays suggested that the antibacterial mechanism of erythorbyl laurate might depend on alterations in the permeability and integrity of cell membranes. Furthermore, erythorbyl laurate showed strong synergistic effects when combined with a variety of antibacterial agents including nisin, kanamycin, and erythromycin (FIC index &lt; 0.28), which might result from increases in bacterial membrane permeability induced by erythorbyl laurate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Antibacterial activity; Erythorbyl laurate; Membrane permeability; Multi-functional food additive; Synergistic effect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042159703

The MM was proposed as a transparent electrode with high conductivity in electrical performance, with proper transparency in optical performance, and low fabrication cost compared to a traditional transparent thin film electrode. To analyze the performance of a transparent antenna fabricated by MM, the antennas were designed to operate in the 2.4-2.5 GHz WLAN band (802.11b). The conductive metal of transparent MM patch antennas was designed using a square lattice structure and was fabricated using wired MM with copper wire (0.2-0.5 mm). In addition, micro-MM film consisting of thin copper wire (20 μm) was used to fabricate transparent patch antennas. The realized gain, efficiency, front-to-back ratio, and radiation patterns of the transparent MM patch antennas are discussed for various combinations of radiator and ground planes.

After transferring nanoimprinted polystyrene thin films onto stretched elastomeric substrates, we achieve microscale wrinkles by releasing the strain. We examine the anisotropic wrinkles of well-defined nanolines with various widths, heights, and spacing ratios and propose a model that considers only bending stiffness of the patterned film. We compare the approach with a model that considers inplane stiffness and confirm that our scheme matches well with that of nanopatterns with thin residual layers.

The porous structure of PCNF was acquired using poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) in the electrospinning solution. In order to obtain the optimized barnacle-like MnO2 on PCNF (MnO2-PCNF), the barnacle-like MnO2 was synthesized using different synthetic times (namely, 1.5, 3.0, and 7.0 min) of the chemical precipitation.

In particular, organization of CNTs with controlled density at the sub-micrometer scale could enable new strategies to engineer optically active surfaces. Here, we present a new strategy to engineer the density-dependent optical properties of CNT forests by patterning of catalyst film via nanoimprint lithography (NIL) followed by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of CNTs. Via this approach, we demonstrate atmospheric pressure growth of CNT structures with widths of 80–350 nm. These structures form self-supporting arrays with height exceeding 500 μm, representing aspect ratios well over 1000:1.

For the wide range detection, two devices in varying length (300 and 700 μm) were used. The corrugated structure was applied for high sensitivity, and the paddle structure was also adopted to enhance the air drag force. The sensor measured the wide range air flow rate from 0.5 up to 8 m/s with a step width at 0.5 m/s. The 700 μm-long sensor showed about 1.5 times larger sensitivity than the 300 μm-long sensor in the low air flow. The results showed that the 700 μm-long device is suitable for low velocity measurements. However, the 300 μm-long sensor showed better sensitivity in the higher air flow; thus, the 300 μm-long sensor is suitable for high velocity measurements. In addition, the embedded temperature sensor measured the basic temperature, and the measured sensitivity was compensated by temperature which could affect the flow sensor. It also showed a linear shape in resistance change related with temperature. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,"Drag; Fabrication; Temperature sensors; Velocity measurement; Air flow-rate; Corrugated structures; Embedded temperature sensors; Flow-sensors; High sensitivity; Range detection; Resistance change; Step widths; Air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032016811

The drying characteristics were confirmed by measuring the amount of condensate with 1-min interval. Results showed that the type of mixing oil changed thermal characteristics. The evaporation rate and drying efficiencies of waste cooking oil showed better results rather than other refined oils. From the TG and DTA test results, the ignition temperature varied depending on oil type. The ignition temperature of drying sludge with refined oil was lower than that with waste cooking oil and raw sludge. The moisture content of dried sludge mixed with oil was less than 3%, however, the sludge dried without any oil showed much higher moisture content of 53.7%.

Following a disaster event, construction service providers are called by clients upon to assist with reconstruction programs. Having knowledge of client values within contracting services in the post disaster situation, service providers are able to provide better service in the disaster rebuild environment. The construction management literature is focused on business-as-usual construction and its relative values, rather than post disaster reconstruction. The objective of this paper is to explore the most important client values within contractor’s services in post disaster reconstruction situations from public and private sector clients’ perspectives. The study includes a literature review and questionnaire survey. Key client values within contracting services under the nine Project Management Institute knowledge management categories were identified. These values can be used as a basis for developing good practice for reconstruction following a disaster.

Therefore, this study improved the robust parameter set (ROPS) selection method for hydrological simulation models to consider multiple rainfall events by combining the Minimax Regret Approach (MRA) with Pareto optimums. A multi-event objective function, which is the linear combination of three weighting values and three Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients, was used and individually solved using a genetic algorithm. All available 63 multi-objective functions with weighting values based on three events were determined and then, the Pareto optimum was derived. These optimized parameter sets were considered as the ROPS candidates for the final selection. This study used two approaches. First, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSEs) for the additional three rainfall events were used to identify the ROPS. Second, four performance indices, the NSE, the Peak Flow Error (PFE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Percent Bias (PBIAS), were used for the other three events. From the results, it can be concluded that the optimized parameter set from the best weighted multi-objective function using multiple events can simulate most rainfall events well with relatively high precision for both the NSE only and the four performance indices. Furthermore, it can be extended to combine multiple events from multiple sites. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","minimax regret; multi-event objective function; pareto optimum; performance index; robust parameter set","Business machines; Genetic algorithms; Mean square error; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Rain; Minimax regret; Objective functions; Pareto optima; Performance indices; Robust parameters; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020172127

For cost-effective manufacturing, a simple solution process was employed to make low-cost composite structure by using 0.15 wt% Ag NWs and 5 wt% ITO-NPs solution. Among 3 types, namely, 2-layer (Ag NWs/ITO-NPs), 2′-layer (ITO-NPs/Ag NWs), and 3-layer (ITO-NPs/Ag NWs/ITO-NPs) sample, the composite structure was optimized as 3-layer, which raised temperature by more than 15% compared to the 1-layer sample (Ag NWs only) at the same voltage. In addition, the 3-layer sample made on Norland optical adhesive 63 (NOA 63) photo-polymeric film exhibited good characteristics as a flexible transparent heater. Optical transmittance at 550 nm (T550) of the 3-layer sample was 89.92%, which was similar to that of the 1-layer sample (90.87%). However, sheet resistance (Rs) of the 3-layer sample was 19.56 Ω/sq., which was remarkably lower than that of the 1-layer sample, 78.45 Ω/sq. In addition, an ultrahigh thermal efficiency (328 °C/(W/cm2)) was achieved from the 3-layer composite structure on the NOA 63 film. Thermal response speed of the 3-layer sample was as ultrafast as 10 s and temperature within 90 °C and 100 °C stably increased and decreased during 60 cycles when applying 5 V. Moreover, the 3-layer sample stably generated heat even under the extreme bending diameter of 5 mm, and heat-generating properties, such as thermal response speed, saturated temperature, and cooling rate, remained almost unchanged even after bending for 1000 cycles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Composite structure; Flexible transparent heater; Photo-polymeric film; Thermal efficiency; Thermal response speed","Composite structures; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Electric resistance measurement; Indium; Nanocomposite films; Nanoparticles; Nanowires; Speed; Structure (composition); Tin; Tin compounds; Tin oxides; Flexible transparent heater; Indium-tin oxide nanoparticles; Optical adhesive; Saturated temperatures; Silver nanowires; Solution-processed; Thermal efficiency; Thermal response; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041408076

Ten topics of PSS research are identified by applying the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to 1229 PSS publications published between 2000 and 2016. The ten PSS topics are briefly reviewed to provide an overview of what has previously been studied in PSS research. We also investigate which topics rise or fall in popularity by identifying hot and cold topics of PSS research. It is observed that the focus of discussions on the benefits of PSS has shifted from sustainability to value creation. Also, increasing attention has been paid to more practical topics such as PSS implementation. The areas of subspecialty of the top ten PSS journals are also examined to explore the interdisciplinary nature of PSS research and thematic differences across disciplines.

The UNSM treatment modified a surface along with subsurface layer with a thickness in the range of 20 to 150 μm, which depends on the UNSM treatment temperature, via the surface severe plastic deformation (S2PD) method. The cross-sectional microstructure of the specimens was observed by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) in order to confirm the microstructural alteration in terms of effective depth and refined grain size. The surface hardness measurement results, including depth profile, revealed that the hardness of the UNSM-treated specimens at both temperatures was increased in comparison with those of the untreated ones. The increase in UNSM treatment temperature led to a further increase in hardness. Moreover, both the UNSM-treated specimens with an increased hardness resulted in a higher resistance to wear in comparison with those of the untreated ones under dry conditions. The increase in hardness and induced compressive residual stress that depend on the formation of severe plastically deformed layer with the refined nano-grains are responsible for the enhancement in wear resistance.

Gauge-based gridded rainfall and temperature data for the period 1961-2010 with spatial resolutions of 0.5° were used. Results showed an increase in the areal extent of droughts during some of the cropping seasons. The occurrences of droughts, particularly moderate droughts with smaller areal extents, were found to increase for all of the seasons. The SPEI values calculated decreased mostly in the regions where rainfall was decreasing. That is, the recent changes in climate were responsible for the increase in the occurrences of droughts with smaller areal extents.

The agricultural water scarcity was assumed to be a system with five subsystems, namely, groundwater depth, surface water availability, rainfall availability, groundwater salinity for irrigation, and surface water salinity for irrigation. The catastrophe-theory-based multi-criteria decision making approach was used for the estimation of agricultural water scarcity index from five subsystem indices. The obtained results showed that agriculture in about 6.3% of the area of the country is experiencing very high-risk water scarcity, 19.1% with high water scarcity, 37.2% with moderate water risk, and the rest is low or no risk of water scarcity for agriculture. Results showed that the western part of Bangladesh was more vulnerable to agricultural water scarcity. The analysis of the results showed that higher agriculture water scarcity in the northwest region resulted from water unavailability, and in the southwest region it was closely related to poor water quality. The severe areas of water scarcity are very similar to those that are usually regarded as water-scarce. The approach presented in this study can be used for rapid but fair assessment of water scarcity with readily available data, which can be further improved by incorporating other factors related to water scarcity. © 2018 by the authors.","Bangladesh; Catastrophe theory; Groundwater; Pre-monsoon; Salinity; Standardized precipitation index; Streamflow; Water scarcity","catastrophe theory; decision making; geographical distribution; groundwater; irrigation system; monsoon; parameterization; resource scarcity; salinity; streamflow; water availability; water quality; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043998556

However, there exist some variables in the production of nZVI that complicate the generation of the material, such as the complex methodologies of synthesis and the cost of inert conditions like nitrogen or argon atmosphere, which have the purpose of preventing the oxidation and reducing the instability of the material under ambient conditions. As a simple and economical synthesis methodology, this work presents an optimized method to synthesize functionalized nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) using ethylene glycol (EG) without need for inert conditions. The coordination of iron ions during the nZVI-EG synthesis and the functionalization mechanism of the nanoparticles were identified by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Functionalized nZVI showed increased dispersibility due to the effects of steric repulsion between the grafted polymers. Ethylene glycol functionalized nZVI showed stability against oxidation during dry atmospheric condition, while significant oxidation was observed in the case of unfunctionalized nZVI.

It can help mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overcome access issues by allowing them to reach into confined spaces. The origami-inspired design enables a foldable structure to be lightweight, compact, and scalable while maintaining its kinematic behavior. However, the lack of structural stiffness has been a major limitation in the practical use of origami-inspired designs. Resolving this obstacle without losing the inherent advantages of origami is a challenge. We propose a solution by implementing a simple stiffening mechanism that uses an origami principle of perpendicular folding. The simplicity of the stiffening mechanism enables an actuation system to drive shape and stiffness changes with only a single electric motor. Our results show that this design was effective for a foldable arm and allowed a UAV to perform a variety of tasks in a confined space.

Here, a facile nondestructive multiscale assembly of multicomponent nanomaterials using self-assembled tyrosine-rich peptide nanofibers (TPFs) as a biological glue is reported. The versatile functionalities of the rationally devised tyrosine-rich short peptide allow for (1) self-assembly of the peptide into nanofibers using noncovalent interactions, followed by (2) immobilization of spatially distributed metal nanoparticles on the nanofiber surface, and (3) subsequent assembly with graphitic nanomaterials into a percolated network-structure. This percolated network-structure of silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-decorated peptide nanofibers with imbedded single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) proves to be a versatile nanoelectrode platform with excellent processability. The SWNT–TPF–AgNP assembly, when utilized as a flexible and transparent multicomponent electronic film, was quite effective for enhancing direct electron transfer (DET) as verified for a third-generation glucose sensor composed of this film.

In particular, how a customer feels for the specific function of the product/service and how their needs have changed is a critical question. According to Kano model dynamics, customer requirements for certain functions change over time, because customers firstly feel attracted to the new service characteristics but come to take them for granted over time. However, previous research on proving this theory has relied on customer surveys and interviews, which are highly time-consuming and expensive. In response, this study suggests customer review-based analysis to investigate Kano model dynamics, because customer reviews can be considered to be excellent sources for reflecting customer needs. This study firstly categorizes customer reviews into two types-positive reviews and supplementation-required reviews-and suggests a five-section framework according to the frequency of each review type. We define characteristics of each section from the perspective of the Kano model. Based on this framework, we analyze the dynamics of customer requirements in the online businesses, for which customer reviews are the main indicator of service quality. © 2018 by the authors.","Customer requirements; Customer review; Dynamics; Kano model","consumption behavior; economic theory; model; product development; service quality; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043381136

Anionic or cationic hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) lenses were polymerized with either vinylpyrrolidone (VP) or N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm). The pH of artificial tears was prepared as between 5.8 and 8.35. One of common treatments, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), to dry eye disease was used as a test drug. As a result, drug releases from anionic 100% p-HEMA and p-HEMA-VP lens were both increased with increasing tear pH. However, released drug amounts from cationic the p-HEMA-NIPAAm lens were decreased with increasing pH. In weak basicity (pH 8.03), the p-HEMA-VP (20 wt%) lens swelled resulting releasing drugs 3.5 times more compared to in weak acidity (pH 5.80). On the other hand, the p-HEMA-NIPAAm (20 wt%) lens de-swelled in basic solution resulting decreased drug release compared to in acidic solution.

In addition, the swirl coefficient and swirl ratio were assessed and compared via measurement of the conventional impulse swirl meter(ISM) and calculation based on the velocity by particle image velocimetry(PIV) from 1.75B position, which was 1.75 times bore position apart from the cylinder head, to the 6.00B position. In this study, the influence of the axial flow on the flow evaluation was examined from 1.75B position to the 6.00B position in order to check the constant axial velocity assumption. For this purpose, the evaluation was performed under the assumption that the axial velocity is proportional to the tangential velocity, and the results were compared with the previous ones. The results showed that the influence of the axial velocity was larger than the effect of the evaluation center setting. Also, the swirl coefficient increased because the increase in momentum around the cylinder wall was much larger than the decrease of the one around the evaluation center when the axial velocity was considered. Furthermore, the tangential and axial velocity distributions were quite similar, but there was also a backflow by recirculation in the axial direction, thereby distorting the measured values. On the other hand, when the momentum was conserved, the swirl coefficient measured by the ISM changed according to the measurement plane position due to the momentum conversion caused by the flow structure change. In the ISM evaluation before 5B, the effects of the change of the flow structure and the backflow were significant. After 5B, the effect of friction increased because the structural change was reduced by the flow development. Finally, despite the angle of attack variation due to the flow progression, its effect was not observed because the influences of tangential and axial flows were offset against each other, and the evaluation value increased as the structure of the flow gradually turned to the ideal form in the evaluation of the PIV.

The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle(PHEV) system, which attracts the attention of consumers in recent years, combines the advantages of an electric vehicle(EV) and a hybrid electric vehicle(HEV). The PHEV system uses a large capacity battery that is charged through a household power source in order to extend the mileage. The PHEV system that can travel long distances with electricity only requires high efficiency electric drive. After the battery is exhausted, the engine must be able to sustain the charge of the battery while driving. Therefore, the loss of power from the engine to the wheels must be small. In this paper, a newly designed system is introduced for the characteristics of PHEV. The system is similar to the parallel TMED type. However, the difference is that a dual clutch is used, a multi-speed transmission is not used, and a motor is attached to each stage. The gear ratio of the system and the capacity of the power source were designed to evaluate the fuel efficiency.

The heat sink had cooling cross section area of 38.0 × 37.0 mm with rectangular fins. The height, length and thickness of a fin was 5.0, 24.0 and 1.0 mm, respectively. The width of fluid channels between the fins was 1.0 mm. The heat sink consisted of a heating and cooling section, and a cover. Two types of heat sinks were used in this study. The two heat sinks were different only in the cover, and the machined depth of the cover was 5.0 and 8.0 mm, respectively. Electric heating from 100 to 300 W was supplied by cartridge heaters and it was equivalent to the heat flux from 71.12 to 213.4 kW/m2 based on the cross section area of the cooled surface. The saturation temperatures of the FC-72 were from 59.8 °C to 71.5 °C during the experiment and the mass fluxes were from 24.2 to 230.0 kg/m2s. The trend of heat transfer and pressure drop variation with the change of vapor quality was similar to that of flow boiling in tubes such as the increase of heat transfer and pressure drop with the increase of vapor quality before dryout. Similar heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop values were measured under the same mass flow conditions for both types of heat sinks.

A series of SR tests were performed under a constant strain of 0.6 % at 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C. The SR behavior of Gr. 91 steel was clarified based on the experimental data. In the modeling of the SR curves, each parameter value for the two models was optimized to give the best fit to the experiment SR data. The springdashpot model did not match the experimental data at 500 and 550 °C, although the model showed good agreement with the experimental data at 600 and 650 °C. However, the Peleg model was superior to the spring-dashpot model for all temperature conditions, and its parameter values followed temperature dependence well. Using the Peleg model, the SR curves for Gr. 91 steel could be suitably modeled at different temperature ranges. The confidence of the Peleg model was validated from elastic-creep finite element analysis. It is suggested that the Peleg model can be a useful tool to characterize the relaxation behavior of Gr. 91 steel. © 2018, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Gr. 91 steel; Peleg model; Relaxation; Spring-dashpot model; Stress relaxation","Curve fitting; Nonlinear systems; Stress relaxation; Temperature distribution; Dashpots; High temperature stress; Peleg model; Relaxation; Relaxation behaviors; Stress-relaxation curves; Temperature conditions; Temperature dependence; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045671721

A surfactant was added to the nanofluid and the change of thermal conductivity and convection heat transfer was also measured. The surfactant was Sodium Dodecyl Benzene Sulfonate (SDBS) and its mass fractions in the nanofluid were from 0.5% to 3.0%. Thermal conductivity of water and nanofluid was measured by the transient hot wire method. The accuracy of the measurement method was confirmed by the measurement error with 0.92% for distilled water at 20°C. The thermal conductivity of the nanofluid without SDBS increased up to 11.3% and the enhancement decreased with time lapse. The reduction of thermal conductivity enhancement with the time lapse could be retarded by the addition of SDBS and its effect became higher with the increase of its mass fraction. The convection heat transfer characteristics of the nanofluid was measured in a small cooling system.

An extruder is a key part of an FDM type printer, in which a filament moves to a heating block and is extruded through a nozzle with a specific diameter. For an appropriate extrusion, the filament should be heated above its softening temperature. Specifically, the filament should not be melted nor softened before it reaches the heating block for appropriate delivery. Hence, the extruder temperature should be carefully controlled to ensure its heating capability as well as its proper delivery. To meet these requirements, thermal-structural finite element (FE) analyses were performed for the prediction of the distributions of temperature and thermal stress.

The seismic behaviors of inverted V-braced frames is that brace buckling occurs due to strong motion generation, and that in turn vertical unbalanced force is created between tension brace and compression brace, resulting in an additional load onto beams. Thus, members of beams should be designed to have enough strength to ensure plastic hinge is not created. In this study, a series of finite element analysis was conducted to evaluate the earthquake-resistant performances of the methods to design the clearance distance of gusset plates in inverted V-braced frames, and to evaluate vertical unbalanced force depending on the cross-section size of beams. It was found that the results of the equation of vertical unbalanced force in the current standards were more conservative than the load generated through the real analysis model. In addition, the model of designing elliptical clearance distance showed higher earthquake-resistant performances than that of designing linear clearance distance, which requires the reconsideration and improvement of the current practices of calculating vertical unbalanced force and setting clearance distance. © 2018, Korean Society of Steel Construction.","cyclic loading; finite element model; gusset plate connections; inelastic behavior; inverted V-braced frames; vertical unbalanced force","Cyclic loads; Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural frames; Analytical investigations; Braced frame; Concentrically braced frames; Current practices; Earthquake resistant; Gusset-plate connections; Inelastic behavior; Vertical unbalanced forces; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043307890

Therefore, this study isolated SDS and/or RS from AS-modified waxy corn starches and investigated their structural characteristics. The amount of SDS+RS and RS had a positive correlation with the proportion of the medium length (13–24 of degree of polymerisation) branched chains of amylopectin. The relative crystallinity increased in the order of AS-modified starch < SDS+RS < RS, while maintaining the B-type crystalline structure. The thermal transition temperature ranges of the isolated fractions were also higher than those of undigested starches. The medium branched chains of amylopectin were presumably the clincher for the SDS and/or RS formation in AS-modified starches.

The twig of S. commixta has been considered valuable for centuries to treat diseases including asthma, cough and other bronchial disorders. However, the effect of S. commixta twig extract on human skin has not been investigated well. The present study aimed at assessing the antiphotoaging effect of S. commixta twig ethanol extract (STE) on ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels and its underlying mechanism in human dermal fibroblasts. In this study, we found that STE (12.5–50 μg mL−1) treatment significantly inhibited UVB-induced MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression, concomitant with a downregulation of intracellular ROS generation. These effects might be associated with a STE-induced inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, STE also downregulated UVB-induced c-Fos expression in a concentration-dependent manner, but had no inhibitory effect on c-Jun phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that STE may be an antiphotoaging agent and that its effect may occur via its inhibition of MMPs expression and MAPK pathway activation. © 2017 The American Society of Photobiology",,"gelatinase A; herbaceous agent; interstitial collagenase; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; mitogen activated protein kinase; radioprotective agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; stromelysin; cell culture; chemistry; dose response; enzymology; fibroblast; genetics; human; metabolism; radiation response; skin; Sorbus; ultraviolet radiation; Cells, Cultured; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Fibroblasts; Humans; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 3; Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Radiation-Protective Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species; Skin; Sorbus; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040719149

This study compares meteorological drought characteristics for two different periods to quantify the temporal changes in seasonal droughts of 18 weather stations of the country. Fifty-five years rainfall and temperature data are divided into two different thirty-year periods, 1961–1990 and 1985–2014 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for those periods are calculated to assess the changes. Four seasons in this study are selected as two major crop growing seasons namely, Rabi (November to April) and Kharif (May to October) and two critical periods for crop growth in term of water supply namely critical Rabi (March–April) and critical Kharif (May). Results show that moderate, extreme, and severe Rabi droughts has increased in 11, 9, and 4 stations out of 18 stations, respectively, and Kharif severe and extreme droughts has increased in 8 and 9 stations, respectively, In addition, the frequency analysis shows that the return periods have decreased during 1985–2014 at the stations where it was high during 1961–1990 and vice versa. This has made the spatial distribution of return periods of droughts more uniform over the country for most of the seasons. Increased return period of droughts in highly drought prone north and northwest Bangladesh has caused decrease in average frequency of droughts. Consequently, this result corresponds that Bangladesh experiences fewer droughts in recent years. Trend analysis of rainfall and temperature data reveals that significant increase of mean temperature and no significant change in rainfall in almost all months have increased the frequency of droughts in the regions where droughts were less frequent. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Bangladesh; Mann-Kendall trend analysis; Seasonal droughts; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index","Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Water supply; Bangladesh; Drought characteristics; Frequency Analysis; Mann-Kendall trends; Meteorological drought; Seasonal droughts; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index; Temporal variation; Drought; cropping practice; drought; evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; trend analysis; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040340185

However, there is no single best validity measure for all types of clustering tasks because individual clustering validity indices have both advantages and shortcomings. Because each validity index has demonstrated its effectiveness in particular cases, it is reasonable to expect that a more generalized clustering validity index can be developed, if individually effective cluster validity indices are appropriately integrated. In this paper, we propose a new cluster validity index, named Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes − cluster validity (CCR-CV), by integrating eight internal clustering efficiency measures based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). The proposed CCR-CV can be used for purposes that are more general because it extends the coverage of a single validity index by adaptively adjusting the combining weights of different validity indices for different datasets. Based on the experimental results on 12 artificial and 30 real datasets, the proposed clustering validity index demonstrates superior ability to determine the optimal and plausible cluster structures compared to benchmark individual validity indices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering validity; Data envelopment analysis; Internal measure; Linear programming","Clustering algorithms; Data envelopment analysis; Data integration; Linear programming; Cluster structure; Cluster validity; Cluster validity indices; Clustering results; Clustering validity; Clustering validity index; Efficiency measure; Internal measure; Cluster analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037975496

While previous studies have demonstrated that the F21W variant leads to attenuated peroxidase activity in DHP, here we have studied the impact of this mutation on peroxygenase activity to determine if it is possible to selectively tune DHP to favor one function over another. Biochemical assays with DHP B (F21W) revealed minimal decreases in peroxygenase activity of 1.2–2.1-fold as measured by 4-nitrophenol or 5-Br-indole substrate conversion, whereas the peroxidase activity catalytic efficiency for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) was more than sevenfold decreased. Binding studies showed a 20-fold weaker affinity for 5-bromoindole (K d  = 2960 ± 940 μM) in DHP B (F21W) compared to WT DHP B. Stopped-flow UV/visible studies and isotope labeling experiments together suggest that the F21W mutation neither significantly changes the nature of the catalytic intermediates, nor alters the mechanisms that have been established for peroxidase and peroxygenase activities in DHP. The X-ray crystal structure (1.96 Å; PDB 5VLX) of DHP B (F21W) revealed that the tryptophan blocks one of the two identified TCP binding sites, specifically TCP interior , suggesting that the other site, TCP exterior , remains viable for binding peroxygenase substrates. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that blocking the TCP interior binding site in DHP selectively favors peroxygenase activity at the expense of its peroxidase activity.

In order to improve the photovoltaic properties of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), we optimized the Nb doping level of the Nb-TiO 2 BLs by controlling the Nb/Ti molar ratio (0, 5, 6, and 7) of the precursor solution for HUSPD. Compared to bare TiO 2 BLs, the Nb-TiO 2 BLs formed a cascading band structure using the positive shift of the conduction band minimum of the Nb-TiO 2 positioned between fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and TiO 2 . This results in the increase of the potential current and the suppression of the electron recombination. Hence, it led to the improvement of the electrical conductivity, due to the increased electron concentration by the Nb doping into TiO 2 . Therefore, the DSSC fabricated with the Nb-TiO 2 BLs at a Nb/Ti molar ratio of 6 showed superior photoconversion efficiency (∼7.50 ± 0.20%) as a result of the improved short-circuit current density. This is higher than those with the other Nb-TiO 2 BLs and without BL. This improvement of the photovoltaic properties for the DSSCs can be attributed to the synergistic effects of uniform and compact BL relative to the prevention of the backward electron transport at the FTO/electrolyte interface, efficient electron transport at interfaces relative to a cascading band structure of FTO/Nb-TiO 2 /TiO 2 multilayers and the facilitated electron transport at the BLs relative to the increased electrical conductivity of the optimized Nb-TiO 2 BLs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Blocking layers; Cascading band structure; Dye-sensitive solar cells; Nb-doped TiO 2; Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis deposition","Band structure; Deposition; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electric conductivity; Electron transport properties; Nanocomposites; Niobium; Photovoltaic effects; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Spray pyrolysis; Tin oxides; Blocking layers; Conduction-band minimum; Electrical conductivity; Electron recombinations; Fluorine doped tin oxide; Nb doped; Photoconversion efficiency; Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis; Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031750470

Data traffic accounts for more than voice traffic. Video traffic accounts for the largest proportion of mobile data traffic and this proportion is increasing. However, various mobile environments affect the status of the mobile network and limit the provision of video services using the Internet. Therefore, a method for improving the quality of experience (QoE) of a video service in mobile environments is required. This paper presents a traffic management method using the mobile edge cloud. The mobile edge cloud is placed in the mobile edge network and monitors the status of mobile terminals. Through the mobile edge cloud, it becomes possible to effectively manage the traffic of mobile terminals by the network. The proposed method manages video traffic from the content server on the Internet according to the edge network status and mobility of a mobile terminal, and provides video traffic to mobile terminals. This method, using the mobile edge cloud, leads to improvement of the QoE for mobile video users. The superiority of this method compared to currently available systems was validated by computer simulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Mobile edge cloud; Mobile video; QoE; Traffic management","Computer terminals; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Wireless networks; Communication device; Edge clouds; Mobile data traffic; Mobile environments; Mobile video; Network traffic; Quality of experience (QoE); Traffic management; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029528577

Emulsions with different oil phase compositions were prepared that were stabilized by polyoxyethylene alkyl ether-type emulsifiers with differently sized hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. Emulsions prepared using only orange oil were highly unstable to Ostwlad ripening during storage. When emulsifier concentration was increased, Ostawald ripening in emulsions containing emulsifiers with small hydrophilic groups was inhibited, while size increment of droplets in emulsions containing emulsifiers with large hydrophilic groups was not. Droplet enlargement was effectively inhibited by incorporating corn oil into the oil phase prior to homogenization. However, the concentration of corn oil required to inhibit Ostwald ripening varied depending on the structural characteristics and concentrations of the emulsifiers present.

The main objective of this study was to examine the differences in safety perception between domestic and foreign workers at Korean construction sites. Methods: A total of 891 Korean and foreign workers were surveyed: 140 foreign and 751 Korean workers. The general characteristics and 25 factors influencing safety perception were considered in the questionnaire. Regression and correlation analyses were conducted to examine the variables of workers’ safety perception. Results: Differences of nationality (F = 7.379, p < 0.001) and workplace accidents were statistically significant for both domestic (F = 1.503, p < 0.05) and foreign workers (F = 7.868, p < 0.05). In contrast, age, education, and Korean language level were significant variables only for foreign workers. Correlation coefficients of 0.428** for Korean and 0.148 for foreign workers between two items – namely, “management's commitment to safety” and “blaming staff when they make mistakes” – support the conclusion that foreign workers do not trust management's commitment to safety, while Korean workers have confidence in these commitments. Conclusion: Foreign workers’ level of safety perception should rise to the same level as Korean workers, especially in terms of obeying safety rules, safety education performance, and safety beliefs. Therefore, an improvement plan for the Korean construction industry is suggested in order to have a better safety level at construction sites with foreign workers. © 2017 The Authors","construction; foreign workers; Korean workers; safety perception","accident; building industry; controlled study; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; education; error; foreign worker; human; human experiment; language; perception; questionnaire; safety; South Korea; staff; trust; workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027163163

Seven different target sizes, four expansion ratios, and 25 locations on a TV were examined in an experiment. Twenty-four people performed the task of pointing at and clicking on a single target on the TV with remote motion control. The results revealed that the target size of 80 mm exhibited the best performance in terms of the task completion time, pointing errors, and pointing convenience. A larger expansion ratio was better, particularly when the target size was smaller than 80 mm. Further, the usability of target locations was statistically analyzed.

This paper presents a regenerative braking strategy of an Induction Motor (IM) drive. This strategy is composed of two stages. First, field-oriented speed control is developed at running and braking modes. Second, power distribution technique is proposed to share the power between the battery and ultracapacitor (UC) in the HESS via a DC-DC converter with buck-boost modes. In motoring operation i.e. discharge mode, a current control technique is used to get the optimal distribution factor for achieving maximum discharge efficiency. In regenerative operation i.e. charging mode, DC-link voltage control mode is adopted. First, the amount of the regenerated power at braking is measured and verified by experimental testes at which the IM is braked using a slip control technique. Then, the IM is excited by the HESS and the discharging/charging of the battery and UC at running/breaking is validated by simulations.

However, because of the poor ionic diffusion of electrode materials, the low-grade ultrafast cycling performance at high current densities remains a considerable challenge. In the present study, seeking to improve the ionic diffusion, we propose a novel design of mesoporous carbon skin on the Si nanoparticles embedded in carbon by hydrothermal reaction, poly(methyl methacrylate) coating process, and carbonization. The resultant electrode offers a high specific discharge capacity with excellent cycling stability (1140 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles), superb high-rate performance (969 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1), and outstanding ultrafast cycling stability (532 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 after 500 cycles). The battery performances are surpassing the previously reported results for carbon and Si composite-based electrodes on LIBs. Therefore, this novel approach provides multiple benefits in terms of the effective accommodation of large volume expansions of the Si nanoparticles, a shorter Li-ion diffusion pathway, and stable electrochemical conditions from a faster ionic diffusion during cycling. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","anode; carbon; Li-ion battery; mesoporous structure; silicon; ultrafast cycling","Anodes; Carbon; Carbonization; Diffusion; Diffusion coatings; Diffusion in solids; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Esters; Ions; Lithium; Mechanical stability; Mesoporous materials; Nanoparticles; Secondary batteries; Silica nanoparticles; Silicon; Electrochemical conditions; High current densities; High electrical conductivity; Hydrothermal reaction; Mesoporous structures; Silicon nanoparticles; Specific discharge capacity; Ultra-fast; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042540752

To gain the optimal catalytic structure, current density peak of flavin adenine dinucleotide redox reaction, electron transfer rate, Michaelis-Menten constants, sensitivity and catalytic stability are measured.

In this study, surface wettability of polycarbonate (PC) films was modified using various surface treatments: Micropatterning using ultrasonic imprint lithography, hydrophobic silane coating, and electron beam irradiation. To modify surface wettability selectively in a specified region, these three treatments were performed using '#'-shaped masks with positive and negative shapes. Various combinations of these treatments were investigated in terms of wettability changes, by measuring contact angle (CA). The semi-hydrophobic PC film (CA: 89.2°) was modified to create a superhydrophobic state (CA: 155.9°) by virtue of the selective micropatterning and coating. The electron beam irradiation had an opposite effect, reducing the CA (48.2°), so the irradiated region was modified to a hydrophilic state. Two combinations of the proposed surface modifications made it possible to obtain considerable difference in CA on a single surface (107.7°), and to obtain four different wetting states on a single surface.

However, the third-order dynamics introduced by LCL filters pose a challenge to design a satisfactory controller for such a system. Conventionally, an LCL-filtered grid-connected inverter can be effectively controlled by using a full-state feedback control. However, this control approach requires the measurement of all system state variables, which brings about more complexity for the inverter system. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic procedure to design an observer-based integral state feedback control for a LCL-filtered grid-connected inverter in the discrete-time domain. The proposed control scheme consists of an integral state feedback controller and a full-state observer which uses the control input, grid-side currents, and grid voltages to predict all the system state variables. Therefore, only the grid-side current sensors and grid voltage sensors are required to implement the proposed control scheme. Due to the discrete-time integrator incorporated in the state feedback controller, the proposed control scheme ensures both the reference tracking and disturbance rejection performance of the inverter system in a practical and simple way. As a result, superior control performance can be achieved by using the reduced number of sensors, which significantly reduces the cost and complexity of the LCL-filtered grid-connected inverter system in DG applications. To verify the practical usefulness of the proposed control scheme, a 2 kW three-phase prototype grid-connected inverter has been constructed, and the proposed control system has been implemented based on 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F28335. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through the comprehensive simulation and experimental results. © 2018 by the authors.","Discrete-time model; DSP TMS320F28335; Grid-connected inverter; Integral state feedback control; LCL filter; State observer","Design; Digital arithmetic; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Discrete time control systems; Disturbance rejection; Electric inverters; Feedback control; State estimation; State feedback; Discrete-time model; DSP TMS320F28335; Grid connected inverters; LCL filters; State observer; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052825970

After heat treatment in hydrogen atmosphere, WO3- NiO powder mixture is completely converted to metallic W without any reaction phases. Camphene slurries with oxide powders are frozen at -30 °C, and pores in the frozen specimens are generated by sublimation of the camphene during drying in air. The green bodies are hydrogen-reduced at 800 °C and sintered at 1000 °C for 1 h. The sintered samples show large and aligned parallel pores to the camphene growth direction, and small pores in the internal wall of large pores. The strut between large pores, prepared from pure WO3 powder, consists of very fine particles with partially necking between the particles. In contrast, the strut densification is clearly observed in the Ni-added W sample due to the enhanced mass transport in activation sintering. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Freeze drying; Hydrogen reduction; Pore structure; Porous W-Ni","Binary alloys; Camphene; Drying; Hydrogen; Low temperature drying; Nickel oxide; Pore structure; Powders; Sintering; Slurries; Struts; Tungsten compounds; After-heat treatment; Camphene-based slurries; Freeze drying; Hydrogen atmosphere; Hydrogen reduction; Reduction behavior; Sintering process; Temperature-programmed reduction; Nickel alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051085719

Methods This study focused on literature research methods. The collected literature about convergence policy and study related to the design-engineering relation for recent 10 years were analyzed for research tendencies and characteristics. The attitudes of the researchers toward design were extracted through an analysis of the contents of the selected documents. Then, the background of the formative attitude of the researchers was analyzed based on the internal and external factors of the design territory. Results The contents of the documents selected in this study mainly focus on the review of the researches and policies related to the study of convergence, and the strategy. Most of the researchers have been perceiving design as an artistic tool of creative thinking. This recognition is based on the internal and external background of design territory such as the devaluation of designer's role due to the lack of understanding and recognition of design and absence of design value evaluation criteria.

The protective effect of these components against 1O2-induced cell damage was also studied by using L-ascorbic acid and (+)-α-tocopherol as controls. Kaempferol exhibited the most potent protective effect, followed by (+)-α-tocopherol and nicotiflorin. L-Ascorbic acid did not exhibit any cellular protective effects. To elucidate the mechanism underlying protective effects, the quenching rate constant of the singlet oxygen, free radical-scavenging activity, ROS-scavenging activity, and uptake ratio of the erythrocyte membrane were measured. The results showed that the cell membrane penetration is a key factor determining the cellular protective effect of kaempferol and its glycoside nicotiflorin. The result from L-ascorbic acid demonstrated that the cellular protective effect of a compound depends on its ability to penetrate the cell membrane and is independent of its antioxidant capacity. In addition, it is suggested that cellular protective effects of kaempferol and (+)-α-tocopherol depend not only on the cell permeability, but also on free radical- and ROS-scavenging activities.

At a 3% jadeite powder content, the skin temperature increased by about 0.5 ℃ when the jadeite powder-containing formulation was applied to the skin. Besides, the chroma of the liquid foundation containing the jadeite powder more clearly expressed the original color of the skin. Moisture content measurements of the wash-off pack and liquid foundation containing the jadeite powder showed the highest moisture uptake of 5.0% and 63.0%, respectively. In sensorial test, the wash-off pack formulations containing the jadeite powder demonstrated improved affinities toward a skin, adherency, and moistness and combatted itching. The liquid foundation containing jadeite powder showed also improved affinities except for the coverage when compared to control formulations. Furthermore, the stability evaluation for 8 weeks revealed neither discoloration nor separation phenomenon for the formulations containing the jadeite powder. Moreover, the pH was found to be stable up to 8 weeks and the viscosity up to 4 weeks. Skin safety assessments showed that all formulations containing the jadeite powder were non-irritating.

In order to conduct more efficient research, experimental methods and results were analyzed statistically. First, effects of five different parameters including the reaction time, temperature, NaOH concentration, reducing agent and ionic liquid amount on the size of silver particles were investigated. As a result, the effects of time and temperature were negligible. The experimental conditions for the other three factors were then statistically constructed. From XRD analyses, the particles synthesized under all conditions had a pure silver crystal structure. Sizes of the synthesized silver particles were also analyzed by HR-SEM. In the three synthetic conditions, NaOH concentration had the greatest influence on determining the size of silver particles and the reducing agent concentration was relatively minute. Synthesis conditions of silver particles with various sizes were presented by using statistical methods with respect to NaOH and ionic liquids. In addition, the sizes of silver particles according to three experimental conditions were derived by the mixture method. © 2018, Korean Society of Industrial Engineering Chemistry.

EDC chemistry was proceeded during grafting of amino acid dihydrazide (ADH) to carboxylic groups in CS and gelatin network in separate reactions, thus obtaining CS–ADH and gelatin–ADH, respectively. CS–acrylate and gelatin–TCEP was obtained through a second EDC chemistry of the unreacted free amines of CS–ADH and gelatin–ADH with acrylic acid and tri(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), respectively. In situ CS–gelatin hydrogel was obtained via click chemistry by simple mixing of aqueous solutions of both CS–acrylate and gelatin–TCEP. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy showed formation of the new chemical bonds between CS and gelatin in CS–gelatin hydrogel network. SEM demonstrated microporous structure of the hydrogel. Within serial precursor concentrations of the CS–gelatin hydrogels studied, they showed trends of the reaction rates of gelation, where the higher concentration, the quicker the gelation occurred. In vitro studies, including assessment of cell viability (live and dead assay), cytotoxicity, biocompatibility via direct contacts of the hydrogels with cells, as well as measurement of inflammatory responses, showed their excellent biocompatibility.

One heme of MauG is five-coordinate and solvent accessible with His53 as axial ligand, while the other heme of MauG is six-coordinate with His205 and Tyr294. MauG catalyzes posttranslational modification including oxygen insertion, cross-linkage of two tryptophan and oxidation of quinol to quinone of precursor methylamine dehydrogenase (preMADH) to form mature tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) which is one of protein-derived cofactors. Long-range remote catalysis of substrate is possible without direct contact between hemes of MauG and its substrate, preMADH. Although catalytic properties and mechanisms of MauG have been well studied, temperature dependence of MauG has never been reported yet.

However, Korea has only small- and medium-sized oil spill response vessels (OSRVs), the size of which is less 2000 tons and has a difficulty in coping with large-scale oil spill accidents. The Korean government is considering the construction of two large OSRVs to enable prompt reduction of the pollution caused by large-scale oil spill accidents. This article aims to assess the public value of building these two large OSRVs. To this end, a survey of 1000 Korean people was conducted using the contingent valuation technique, eliciting Korean people's willingness to pay (WTP) for constructing the OSRVs. The mean yearly WTP for the construction is calculated to be KRW 3721 (USD 3.18) per household. When the sample is expanded to the whole country, it is worth KRW 71.8 billion (USD 61.3 million) per annum. Therefore, constructing the two large OSRVs will contribute to the Korean people's utility and can be done with public support. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Large oil spill response vessel; Oil spill accident; Willingness to pay","accident; contingent valuation; oil spill response; pollution control; risk assessment; vessel; willingness to pay; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037333007

In terms of flaw shape, three different shapes of flaws which can be detected during an actual ISI are considered, i.e., long symmetric flaw, asymmetric inclined flaw and narrow, symmetric deep flaw. As for flaw shape idealization methods for the predictions of burst pressures of these flaws, four different flaw shape idealization models, i.e., semi-elliptical, rectangular, maximum length with effective flaw depth and weakest subcrack model proposed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) are employed in this work. In order to validate the applicability of these idealization methods, the burst pressures of SG tubes with these flaws are investigated by using the finite element (FE) analyses. By comparing the predictions of the burst pressures based on the four different flaw shape idealization methods with those based on actual flaw shapes, it is found that the weakest subcrack model proposed by the EPRI and maximum length with effective flaw depth model provide the better agreement with actual complex flaw. © Copyright 2018 by ASME.","axial surface flaw; burst pressure; flaw shape idealization; steam generator tube; weakest subcrack model","Descaling; Finite element method; Fuel tanks; Numerical methods; Tubes (components); Burst pressures; Different shapes; Electric Power Research Institute; In-service inspection; Numerical validations; Steam generator tube; Structural integrity assessment; Surface flaw; Steam generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037057631

Particle size increased with the number of layers in the multilayer and the zeta potential varied between positive and negative values with alternate deposition of polyelectrolytes. Finally, approximately 300–400 nm-thick four-layered liposomes were prepared.

HetNets that populate many small cells within each macrocell have been studied extensively as a promising solution to exponentially increasing traffic demands. To benefit from small cells, traffic loads are efficiently spread over the network through user association, and strong interference from macrocells are carefully controlled. A simple but very effective solution is resource blanking that partitions time slots into two orthogonal groups and dedicates them to macrocells and small cells exclusively. The underlying challenge is the distributed management of joint user association and resource blanking because a centralized coordination becomes intractable for highly dense HetNets. Unlike existing approaches, this paper aims at developing a distributed solution for this joint optimization task without relaxing nonlinear constraints or decoupling the joint optimization. To this target, a novel message-passing algorithm is developed that enables a fully distributed solution for the joint optimization. The presented approach includes consensus mechanism that determines the optimal macrocell blanking via the negotiation among base stations. Simulation results show that the developed algorithm provides very efficient solutions and outperforms existing techniques consistently. © 2017 IEEE.","heterogeneous networks; load balancing; Message-passing; resource blanking","Heterogeneous networks; Optimization; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Wave interference; Wireless telecommunication systems; Blanking; Heterogeneous network (HetNets); Macro cells; Message passing algorithm; Non-linear constraints; resource blanking; Self-organizing approaches; Wireless communications; Message passing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035803489

Here we propose a microporous composite separator prepared by introducing a polymeric coating layer of polyvinylidene fluoride–hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP co-polymer) with ZrO2 nanoparticles to a polyethylene (PE) separator. The coated separator efficiently enhances the cell performance of SIBs. The ZrO2 nanoparticles, finely dispersed on the polymeric coating layer, induce the formation of many micropores on the polymeric coating layer, suggesting that micropore formation on the coating layer renders the composite separator more open in structure. An ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate liquid electrolyte for SIBs is not absorbed by PE separators even after 1 h of electrolyte droplet testing, while the proposed separator with many micropores is completely wetted by the electrolyte. Sodium ion migration across the composite separator is therefore effectively enhanced by the formation of ion transfer pathways, which improve ionic conductivity. As a result, the microporous composite separator affords stable cycle performances and excellent specific capacity retention (95.8%) after 50 cycles, comparable to those offered by a SIB with a GF separator. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Separator; Sodium ion battery; Sodium ion transfer; Wettability; Zirconium dioxide","Coatings; Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Ethylene; Fluorine compounds; Ions; Metal ions; Microporosity; Nanoparticles; Polymers; Secondary batteries; Wetting; Zirconium compounds; Electrochemical performance; Gravimetric energy densities; Liquid electrolytes; Microporous composite; Polyvinylidene fluorides; Sodium ion batteries; Sodium ions; Zirconium dioxide; Separators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035746204

FIT was implemented from 2002 to 2011, while RPS has been in force since 2012; hence, a comparative analysis of the two policies is ideal. The benefit cost ratio and net present value were measured from two different perspectives: the government and energy producers. The results showed that RPS was more efficient for photovoltaic energy from the government's perspective, whereas FIT, for non-photovoltaic energy, such as wind power, bio-energy, and fuel cells.

The cement industry plays a crucial role in emissions reduction because it accounts for a substantial proportion of global emissions. This study analyzes the inter-fuel substitution paths for the cement industry, along with its impacts on emissions reduction. A mixed multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model is used to accommodate for the heterogeneity of firms’ preferences for fuel mixes. The proposed model is empirically verified using firm-level data collected from 1998 to 2011 for Korean cement production firms. The results show that firms’ marginal utilities from using bituminous coal are still larger than those from other alternative fuels. The determinants of the firms’ alternative fuel choices are different according to the individual fuel types, but the price of bituminous coal has a primary impact, generally speaking. Scenario analysis shows that 10% and 20% increases in bituminous coal prices will lead to roughly 1.30 million and 1.58 million tons of CO2 reduction for the Korean cement industry, respectively. This study analyzes the selection and consumption patterns according to fuel types among cement producers, and also predicts its impacts on emissions reduction. Further, our study also provides policy implications for the government, which plays a crucial role in designing incentives for firms to use alternative fuels more often. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuels; Cement industry; Emissions reduction; Inter-fuel substitution","Bituminous coal; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Coal; Coal industry; Emission control; Fuels; Industrial emissions; Public policy; Regression analysis; Cement production; Consumption patterns; Emissions reduction; Fuel substitution; Global emissions; Mixed multiple discrete-continuous extreme values; Policy implications; Scenario analysis; Alternative fuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033368343

For this problem traditionally the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm has been broadly used. However, it suffers from bad local maxima, and the quality of the estimator is sensitive to the initial model choice. Recently, an alternative density estimator has been proposed that is based on matching the moments between sample averaged and model averaged. This moment matching estimator is typically used as the initial iterate for the EM algorithm for further refinement. However, there is actually no guarantee that the EM-refined estimator still yields the moments close enough to the sample-averaged one. Motivated by this issue, in this paper we propose a novel estimator that takes merits of both worlds: we do likelihood maximization, but the moment discrepancy score is used as a regularizer that prevents the model-averaged moments from straying away from those estimated from data. On some crowd-sourcing label prediction problems, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields more accurate density estimates than the existing estimators. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Crowd-sourcing label prediction problem; Density estimation; Expectation maximization; Moment matching","Forecasting; Maximum likelihood; Maximum principle; Probability density function; Density estimation; Expectation - maximizations; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Label predictions; Moment-matching; Parameter estimation problems; Probability densities; Refined estimators; Maximum likelihood estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023199032

However, the IE data over the near-surface delamination typically developed by rebar corrosion at the cover depth is not easy in interpreting because of the difficulties in the dynamic analysis of flexural modes over the defects as well as in the identification of weak and unclear signal of the high IE frequency corresponding to the delamination depth. The shallow delamination in the concrete structures must be clearly identified and interpreted such that infrastructure engineers can effectively check the condition of the structure. To address this problem, we proposed the combined dynamic characterization with both impact-echo and flexural modes in order to identify the area and degree of damage and applied this technique to the designated concrete slab and the simulated bridge deck with various artificial defects at the depth of rebar. The test results proved that the imaging technique by the combined mode associated with the IE and flexural modes is more effective and accurate for the detection of shallow defects in the concrete slab than one by the individual mode. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","concrete; damage identification; flexural mode; impact-echo mode; near-surface defect; non-destructive testing; shallow delamination","Bridge decks; Bridges; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concrete slabs; Concrete testing; Concretes; Damage detection; Delamination; Dynamic analysis; Imaging techniques; Surface defects; Damage Identification; Flexural modes; Impact echo; Near-surface defects; Non destructive testing; Nondestructive examination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014884875

This paper aims to evaluate the economic benefits of the restoration using contingent valuation (CV), and to then perform a cost-benefit analysis of the restoration. For this purpose, people's willingness to pay (WTP) for the restoration is elicited from a survey of 1000 households. The average household's WTP is estimated as KRW 2341 (USD 2.07) per annum. The current values of the benefits and costs of the restoration computed for the relevant period and population are KRW 415.3 billion (USD 366.9 million) and KRW232.2 billion (USD 205.1 million), respectively. As the former is more than the latter, the restoration is socially profitable. © 2018 by the authors.","Contingent valuation; Cost-benefit analysis; Hwangnyongsa Temple; Willingness to pay","building; contingent valuation; cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; environmental restoration; governance approach; household survey; willingness to pay; World Heritage Site; Gyeongju; North Kyongsang; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041505201

For doing that, mesoporous tungsten oxide (m-WO 3 ) and oxyniride (m-WON) structures are proposed as the novel catalysts, while m-WON is gained by NH 3 heat treatment of m-WO 3 . Their specific surface area, crystal structure, surface morphology and component analysis are measured using BET, XRD, TEM and XPS, while their catalytic activity for V 2+ /V 3+ redox reaction is electrochemically examined. As a result, the m-WON shows higher peak current, smaller peak potential difference, higher electron transfer rate constant and lower charge transfer resistance than other catalysts, like the m-WO 3 , WO 3 nanoparticle and mesoporous carbon, proving that it is superior catalyst. Regarding the charge-discharge curve tests, the VRFB single cell employing the m-WON demonstrates high voltage and energy efficiencies, high specific capacity and low capacity loss rate. The excellent results of m-WON are due to the reasons like (i) reduced energy band gap, (ii) reaction familiar surface functional groups and (ii) greater electronegativity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy band gap; Mesoporous tungsten oxynitride; Mesoporous tungsten oxynitride; V 2+ /V 3+ redox reaction; Vanadium redox flow batteries","Band structure; Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Crystal structure; Electrocatalysts; Electronegativity; Energy efficiency; Energy gap; Flow batteries; Mesoporous materials; Nitrides; Rate constants; Surface reactions; Tungsten compounds; Vanadium; Charge discharge curves; Charge transfer resistance; Electron-transfer rate constants; High specific capacity; Mesoporous tungsten oxide; Oxynitrides; Surface functional groups; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Redox reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024893817

Here, the AgNPs play a role in obstructing denaturation of the GOx molecules from the supporter because of Ag-thiol bond, while the PEIs have the AgNPs keep their states without getting ionized by hydrogen peroxide produced during anodic reaction. The Naph-SHs also prevent ionization of the AgNP by forming self-assembled monolayer on their surface. Such roles of each component enable the catalyst to form (i) hydrophobic interaction between the GOx molecules and supporter and (ii) π-conjugated electron pathway between the GOx molecules and AgNP, promoting electron transfer. Catalytic nature of the catalyst is characterized by measuring catalytic activity and performance of enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) using the catalyst. Regarding the catalytic activity, the catalyst leads to high electron transfer rate constant (9.6 ± 0.4 s −1 ), low Michaelis-Menten constant (0.51 ± 0.04 mM), and low charge transfer resistance (7.3 Ω cm 2 ) and high amount of immobilized GOx (54.6%), while regarding the EBC performance, high maximum power density (1.46 ± 0.07 mW cm −2 ) with superior long-term stability result are observed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anodic catalyst; Enzymatic biofuel cell; Naphthalene-thiol based couplers; Silver nanoparticle; Silver-thiol bond","Biocatalysts; Biofuels; Carbon nanotubes; Charge transfer; Electron transitions; Enzymatic fuel cells; Glucose; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensors; Hydrophobicity; Ionization; Metal nanoparticles; Molecules; Naphthalene; Rate constants; Self assembled monolayers; Silver nanoparticles; Synthesis (chemical); Yarn; Charge transfer resistance; Electron-transfer rate constants; Glucose oxidases (GOx); Hybrid biocatalysts; Hydrophobic interactions; Long term stability; Maximum power density; Michaelis-Menten constant; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023642028

However, the plane level parallelism has not been sufficiently exploited, because of the constraint that the target pages of the planes must be in the same location. To overcome this constraint, a policy that enforces the multi-plane operation by matching the position of the target pages while wasting clean pages is proposed. However, this policy excessively increases the number of block erasures, which leads to reducing the stability and lifetime of the SSD. To solve this problem, this Letter proposes a policy that determines whether to perform the multi-plane operation considering the number of wasted clean pages. The performance evaluation using representative server workloads shows that the proposed policy improves an average performance by up to 28.82% over the policy that does not perform the multi-plane operation, without significantly increasing the number of block erasures.",,"Channel-level; Chip-level; Multi planes; Number of blocks; Solid state drives; Electronics engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041114922

The 'screeding method' (like a concrete finishing process) has been employed to develop the Alg-α-TCP film. For this method, the Alg/α-TCP blend has been prepared using an ultra-sonicator and then put on a glass slide. After that, the excess volume of blend has been cut off by skidding another slide along with the surface of the blend to achieve proper grade and flatness. The mechanical strength and flexibility of the film (Alg-α-TCP) has been controlled by changing its compositions. The crosslinking phenomenon has been confirmed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), x-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses. The ATR-FTIR and 13 C NMR analysis results suggest that carboxylate groups of the alginate are ionically cross-linked with Ca 2+ ions, while the α-TCP particles reside in the network by physical interaction. The micro-fatigue test results imply high tensile strength (up to 257 MPa) and flexibility (up to 13% elongation) of the Alg-α-TCP hybrid films. The SEM analysis suggests the α-TCP particles are homogeneously distributed on the surface of Alg-α-TCP films, whereas cross-sectional images confirmed the presence of α-TCP in the cross-linked network. TGA results demonstrated that thermal stability of the hybrid film was enhanced due to ionic crosslinking and interfacial interaction between alginate and α-TCP. The incorporation of α-TCP particles diminished the swelling ratio of the hybrid film. The in vitro bone cell (MC3T3) culture and cytotoxicity tests showed that the hybrid film is biocompatible. The hybrid film releases bovine serum albumin and dimethyloxaloylglycine in a controlled way at pH 7 and 7.4, and 37 °C. Overall, the biocompatible Alg-α-TCP hybrid film with excellent mechanical strength and flexibility could be applied as an interfacial film in tissue engineering. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","alginate; biomaterials; calcium phosphate; crosslinking; hybrid film","Alginate; Biocompatibility; Biomaterials; Biomechanics; Body fluids; Calcium chloride; Calcium phosphate; Carboxylation; Crosslinking; Fatigue testing; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Supersaturation; Tensile strength; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Tissue engineering; Volumetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopies (ATR FTIR); Cross sectional image; High mechanical properties; Hybrid film; Interfacial interaction; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR); Synthesis and characterizations; Tri-calcium phosphates; Transmission control protocol; alginic acid; alpha calcium phosphate; antibiotic agent; biomaterial; bovine serum albumin; calcium ion; calcium phosphate; carboxylic acid; dimethyloxallyl glycine; glycine; unclassified drug; alginic acid; alpha-tricalcium phosphate; biomaterial; bovine serum albumin; calcium phosphate; dimethyloxallyl glycine; glucuronic acid; glycine; hexuronic acid; animal cell; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell culture; chemical analysis; chemical composition; controlled study; cross linking; cytotoxicity; drug synthesis; hybrid; image analysis; in vitro study; infrared spectroscopy; MC3T3 cell line; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; pH; scanning electron microscopy; tensile strength; thermogravimetry; thermostability; tissue engineering; X ray diffraction; analogs and derivatives; bone; cell proliferation; chemistry; cross-sectional study; human; mechanical stress; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; procedures; temperature; Alginates; Biocompatible Materials; Bone and Bones; Calcium Phosphates; Cell Proliferation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Glucuronic Acid; Glycine; Hexuronic Acids; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Stress, Mechanical; Temperature; Tensile Strength; Thermogravimetry; Tissue Engineering; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034452645

Importantly, the detection limit for Cu2+ was found to be 0.12 μM, which was much lower than the recommended value (31.5 μM) of the World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, 1 could detect and quantify Cu2+ in real water samples.

The saturation concentration of the branched-chain amino acids increased from 3.81% to 4.42% and 4.85% after the incorporation of food hydrocolloids and proteins, respectively. However, the branched-chain amino acids:stabilizer ratio did not affect the solubility. In the case of food hydrocolloid-based solutions, crystal formation and growth of branched-chain amino acids occurred during storage, resulting in the precipitation of branched-chain amino acid crystals. However, food proteins effectively increased the stability of the solubilized branched-chain amino acids.

Under quasi-static strain rate range, serrated flow and negative strain-rate dependence of flow stress were found during room-temperature tensile testing. The serrated flow is closely related to dynamic strain aging induced by the interaction of dislocation and interstitial carbon. In order to understand the flow stress contribution of strain hardening rate and strain rate sensitivity, strain rate jumping test was performed. The results showed that the negative strain-rate dependence of flow stress was more dependent on strain hardening rate factor than strain rate sensitivity factor by dynamic strain aging. EBSD and TEM analysis revealed that the higher strain hardening rate at lower strain rate was attributed to the higher fraction and finer thickness of deformation twin. The localized stress accompanied by dynamic strain aging plays an important role in twinning process since it decreases effective stacking fault energy and promotes deformation twinning in localized region at lower strain rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Austenitic; Dynamic strain aging; Serration; Strain rate; Twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel","Austenite; Carbon; Deformation; Hardening; Iron compounds; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Plastic flow; Plasticity; Stainless steel; Strain hardening; Tensile testing; Austenitic; Dynamic strain aging; Interaction of dislocations; Quasi-static strain rates; Serration; Stacking fault energies; Strain rate sensitivity; Twinning induced plasticity steels; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033363216

The line lasers are deployed at either side of the camera to eliminate shadow areas of a target object. This study addresses the calibration methods for the parameters of the camera, the plane equations covered by the line lasers, and the center of the rotation table. Experimental results demonstrate the performance in terms of accurate color and 3D data acquisition in this study. © 2018 Current Optics and Photonics.","Calibration; Color 3D scanner; Line laser; Rotation table; Structured-light","Calibration; Cameras; Data acquisition; Multispectral scanners; Scanning; 3-D scanner; 3D data acquisition; Calibration method; Correspondence algorithm; Laser-structured light; Natural color images; Structured Light; Structured-light imaging; Color",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069462727

According to the electrochemical analysis, although all of the catalysts applied have a similar influence on the V(IV)/V(V) reaction, for the V(II)/V(III) reaction, the sulfenic acid-doped MC shows better catalytic activity with a faster electron transfer rate and narrower peak potential separation. Nyquist plots also support the superiority of the sulfenic acid-doped MC catalyst with a smaller charge transfer resistance. When the catalysts are loaded onto a negative electrode for measuring the performance of VRFB, the VRFB using sulfenic acid-doped MC catalyst shows 6∼10% higher voltage efficiency and 5∼12% higher energy efficiency than other VRFBs. The excellent catalytic activity of the catalyst for the V(II)/V(III) reaction and superior performance of VRFB are due to an increase in the –SOxH bond that acts as an active site for the reaction. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Carbon; Charge transfer; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Foams; Redox reactions; Charge transfer resistance; Electrochemical analysis; Electron transfer rates; Mesocellular carbon foams; Mesoporous carbon; Negative electrode; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Voltage efficiencies; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067416473

The applicable felds become much wider including the topographic monitoring, agriculture, and forestry. It is reported that the high geospatial accuracy is achievable with the drone photogrammetry for many applications. However most studies reported the best achievable mapping results using well-distributed ground control points though some studies investigated the impact of control points on the accuracy. In this study, we focused on the drone mapping of corridors such as roads and pipelines. The distribution and the number of control points along the corridor were diversified for the accuracy assessment. In addition, the effects of the camera self-calibration and the number of the image strips were also studied. The experimental results showed that the biased distribution of ground control points has more negative impact on the accuracy compared to the density of points. The prior camera calibration was favored than the on-the-fy self-calibration that may produce poor positional accuracy for the case of less or biased control points.

All the steels are composed mostly of polygonal ferrite, acicular ferrite, granular bainite, and bainitic ferrite. After 1% pre-strain and thermal aging treatment, the tensile test results reveal that yield strength, tensile strength and yield ratio increase, while uniform elongation decreases with an increasing thermal aging temperature. The increment of yield and tensile strengths are affected by the fraction of bainitic ferrite with high dislocation density because the mobility of dislocations is inhibited by interaction between interstitial atoms and dislocations in bainitic ferrite.

This is relatively vital to the bearing capacity of the track and the dynamic behavior of the train. It also affects the quality of the track geometry, and the lifespan of track components. When track stiffness is adequate, sufficient load can be resisted, resulting in reduced deflection. Hence, minimizing track deterioration is important. However, if track stiffness is too high, dynamic load imposed on the sleeper and ballast, and at the wheel-rail interface, increases. This can cause accelerated wear and fatigue of track components. On the other hand, if stiffness is lower than the acceptable range, excessive track displacement can occur. Therefore, during the design of the track structure, it is important to determine the optimum track stiffness. Unfortunately, proper track stiffness criteria for each type of track structure have not yet been provided. Therefore, static and dynamic track stiffness were systematically analyzed in this study by investigating wheel weight and rail deflection, measured through a full-scale test. In addition, a field test of asphalt concrete directly fastened to track was also performed.

However, due to settlement of earthwork sections, track irregularities have occurred in high-speed railways constructed with concrete track. In Korea, train stability has been considered mainly for track irregularity sections and study on load transferred to track and trackbed has been insufficient. In this study, changes of dynamic wheel-load during high-speed running are analyzed in earthwork sections where track vertical irregularity has occurred. Using the moving loading method, numerical analyses were conducted to investigate the maximum stress. Rail surface leveling was performed to select measurement points, and the dynamic wheel loads for each point were measured for train speed of 300km/h. The characteristics of load acting on the rail were analyzed by comparing a normal section and a defective section for which track vertical irregularity has occurred. © 2018 The Korean Society for Railway.

Generally, the non-open cut method is applied when non-avoidable vehicles or trains are in service on the ground. This method is usually applied in urban areas. Since the ground depth above the non-open cut method applied is usually low in urban areas, loads on the upper ground are likely to occur as brittle failure on the surface. In order to minimize the displacement of the upper ground, each non-open cut method using steel pipe reinforcement is applied. However, this can bring many problems when steel pipes are press-fitted and reinforced before the excavation. This research tried to compare the displacement by complex behavior for multi-press fitted steel pipe condition with single press-fitted condition. Laboratory tests were conducted to investigate complex behavior under horizontal and vertical multi-press fitted steel pipe conditions. Field tests were also performed in a test construction site by measuring surface settlement during press-fitting of small diameter pipes.

Further development towards disease can then be prevented by dietary antioxidants. The present study was aimed at assessing the relationship between diet quality, blood antioxidants, and oxidative damage to determine whether the association between these markers differs by oxidative stress status. For a cross-sectional analysis, we used data and samples of baseline information from a prospective cohort study. A total of 1229 eligible adults were classified into apparently healthy subjects (66.5%) and those with oxidative stress conditions (35.5%). Diet quality was assessed using the recommended food score (RFS). Plasma carotenoids (blood antioxidants) and blood/urinary malondialdehyde (MDA; oxidative damage) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. We found that the healthy group was younger, and they had a lower RFS and plasma MDA level and higher plasma carotenoids compared to the oxidative stress condition group. This result is probably due to the quenching of the oxidative response in the tissues of those people. A positive association of RFS with plasma carotenoids (total and β-carotene) was found in both groups, suggesting that carotenoids are a robust reflection of diet quality. Negative associations were observed between plasma MDA and RFS in the oxidative stress condition group and between urinary MDA and plasma zeaxanthin in the healthy group. Erythrocyte MDA was positively associated with plasma carotenoids (total, lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, and α- and β-carotene), regardless of health condition, probably also as a result of the use of carotenoids as antioxidants. In conclusion, these results indicate that the above three factors may be associated with the oxidative stress response and depend on the oxidative status. Furthermore, it was also suggested that erythrocytes are important in the oxidative stress response and the quenching of this response is represented in plasma carotenoids.

As more and more of such data become available, clustering is needed to understand the structure of sequence data. However, the existing clustering algorithms for sequence data are computationally demanding. To avoid such a problem, a feature-based clustering algorithm has been proposed. Notwithstanding that, the algorithm uses only a subset of all possible frequent sequential patterns as features, which may result in the distortion of similarities between sequences in practice, especially when dealing with sequence data with a large number of distinct items such as customer transaction data. Developed in this article is a feature-based clustering algorithm using a complete set of frequent sequential patterns as features for sequences of sets of items as well as sequences of single items which consist of many distinct items. The proposed algorithm projects sequence data into feature space whose dimension consists of a complete set of frequent sequential patterns, and then, employs K-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm generates more meaningful clusters than the compared algorithms regardless of the dataset and parameters such as the minimum support value of frequent sequential patterns and the number of clusters considered. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be applied to a large sequence database since it is linearly scalable to the number of sequence data. © The Korean Institute of Intelligent Systems.","Feature-based clustering; Frequent sequential patterns; Sequence data",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059838298

Typically, viscoelastic characteristics have been used to derive asphalt dynamic moduli; compressive frequency sweep tests at different frequencies (Hz) and temperatures are employed to this end. We compared IRT-derived viscoelastic master curves obtained via compressive frequency sweep testing to those derived using the EKF algorithm, which employs a nonlinear sigmoidal curve and a Taylor series to explore the viscoelastic function.

The CPS is a new paradigm that seeks to converge the physical and cyber worlds in which we live. However, the CPS suffers from certain CPS issues that could directly threaten our lives, while the CPS environment, including its various layers, is related to on-the-spot threats, making it necessary to study CPS security. Therefore, a survey-based in-depth understanding of the vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks is required of CPS security and privacy for IoT. In this paper, we analyze security issues, threats, and solutions for IoT-CPS, and evaluate the existing researches.

However, the existing MCMC inference algorithms for GPSAM have proven to be slow in practice. In this paper we propose novel and scalable variational inference algorithms for GP-SAM that reduce the time complexity of the sampling approaches and improve scalability to large datasets. We accomplish this by employing two effective strategies in scalable GP: i) using pseudo inputs and ii) approximation via random feature expansions. In both setups, we derive the full and partial likelihood formulations, typically considered in survival analysis settings. The proposed approaches are evaluated on two clinical and a divorce-marriage benchmark datasets, where we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy over the existing survival analysis methods, while reducing the complexity of inference compared to the recent state-of-the-art MCMC-based algorithms. © 2018 by Association For Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (AUAI) All rights reserved.",,"Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Inference engines; Benchmark datasets; Cox proportional hazard model; Gaussian process models; Gaussian Processes; Inference algorithm; Partial likelihoods; Prediction accuracy; Variational inference; Uncertainty analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059367688

Chemical and optical evaluations of the catalysts are characterized using BET, FT-IR, XPS, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and SEM/STEM and they are used as the catalysts for redox reactions of vanadium ions and redox flow battery (VRFB) performance. In the utilization, m-NC@NCNT and m-NCNT are effective for improving VO 2+ /VO 2 + redox reaction, although m-NC does not influence that. Even in VRFB tests using the catalysts, charge/discharge potential and energy efficiency (EE) of m-NC@NCNT and m-NCNT are highest, not to mention excellent EE resilience after undergoing tougher cycling condition. These results are due to the large graphitic-N portion of the two catalysts. Namely, electrons produced by the graphitic-N are delocalized, forming pi-conjugated system and vanadium–nitrogen transition state.

The α-tocopherol concentration remaining after 3 weeks of storage at 25°C depended greatly on the type of oxidative stress, which indicated that the environment surrounding the oil droplets could determine the stability of α-tocopherol in nanoemulsions. α-Tocopherol was gradually degraded by radical-mediated oxidation over storage, and approximately 60% of its initial concentration remained after 3 weeks of storage. However, under acid- and iron-mediated oxidation, α-tocopherol concentration steeply decreases for the initial 3-day storage, but the degradation rate of α-tocopherol decreased after 3 days of storage and over 90% of the initial α-tocopherol remained after 3 weeks of storage. Interestingly, and contrary to our expectations, the thickness and/or density of the droplet interfacial membrane rarely affected the stability of α-tocopherol incorporated into nanoemulsions.

It is one of the leading research topics which have the ability to replace the existing biomaterials and medical devices and to development new biomaterials. The innovation and development in this research area are growing quickly because of the state-of-the-art techniques like nanobiotechnology, biosensors, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and 3D (bio)printing. These techniques can mimic the biomacromolecules, peptide sequences, morphology, chemical and physical structures more precisely than other currently available methods. The importance of hydrogels and its composites as examples among many other biomaterials are increasing vastly because of their recent advancements in its biological, chemical and physical cues which are biomimetic to native tissues. Furthermore, an enhancement in the 3D bioprinting technology where live cells are printed along with biomaterials demonstrates the capabilities of this technology to innovate novel tissue engineering products in micro- to macro-technology.

In some situations, flaws can be detected in locations where an appropriate crack model is not readily available. For instance, there are no practical stress intensity factor solutions for circular-arc cracks which can form in circular welds (e.g., nozzle to vessel shell welds and storage cask closure welds). In this paper, stress intensity factors for circular-arc cracks in finite plates were calculated using finite element analysis. As a first step, stress intensity factors for circular-arc through-wall crack under uniform tension and crack face pressure were calculated. These results were compared with the analytical solutions which showed reasonable agreement. Then, stress intensity factors were calculated for circular-arc semi-elliptical surface cracks under the lateral and crack face pressure loading conditions. Lastly, to investigate the applicability of straight crack solutions for circular-arc cracks, stress intensity factors for circular-arc and straight cracks (both through-wall and surface cracks) were compared.

The PIP is a type of pipe applied in sodium-cooled faster reactor(SFR) and has a different geometry from a single pipe. In particular, under the high temperature condition of the SFR, the high thermal stress is generated due to the temperature gradient occurring between the inner pipe and outer pipe. To investigate the thermal stress characteristics, three cases are considered according to geometry of the support. The fully constrained support and intermediate support are considered for case 1 and 2, respectively. For case 3, both supports are applied to the actual curved pipe. The finite element(FE) analyses are performed in two steps for each case. Firstly, the heat transfer analysis is carried out considering the thermal conduction, convection and radiation conditions. From the heat transfer analysis, the temperature distribution results in the piping system are obtained. Secondly, the structural analysis is performed considering the temperature distribution results and boundary conditions. Finally, the effects of the geometric characteristics on the thermal stress in the PIP system are analyzed.

Ductile failure is quantified in terms of strain, representing the tensile strain capacity (TSC) which is commonly used in strain-based assessment for fitnessfor-service of pipelines installed in frozen area where largescale ground movement can arise due to earthquakes, freezing and thawing. Based on the local failure criterion suggested for API X70 steel material, the TSCs of the corroded pipelines are evaluated by using the detailed finite element (FE) analyses. The effects of internal pressure and defect size (such as longitudinal length, circumferential width and depth in the direction of thickness) on TSC of pipelines subjected to axial displacement are systematically investigated. In addition, TSCs based on local failure criterion are compared with those based on net-section limit load. The TSCs from the present FE analyses for various defect geometries and internal pressure can be used to predict ductile failure of corroded pipelines and to build the framework for a strain-based assessment for in-service pipelines.

The TSC can be determined by using two kinds of failure criteria. One is based on the limit state corresponding to an onset of stable crack growth and the other is tangency approach which determines an onset of unstable crack growth by comparing crack driving force and resistance curve. For this reason, the accurate calculation of crack driving force and crack resistance curve is highly required to determine TSC. In the present study, the TSCs for X70 pipelines with a circumferential semi-elliptical surface crack were estimated based on both crack initiation and ductile tearing criteria using crack driving force diagram (CDFD) method. The CDF curves of cracked pipelines were calculated through the detailed elastic-plastic finite element (FE) analyses. Crack resistance curves were obtained from experimental data of single edged notch tension (SENT) specimens. Both the CDF and crack resistance curves were represented using CTOD and J-integral, respectively. As for loading conditions, axial strain and internal pressure were considered. The TSCs based on CTOD were compared with those based on J-integral to investigate the effect of choice of the fracture parameters on TSC. From the FE results, the TSCs based on ductile tearing allowed higher TSCs than those based on crack initiation. Although there were some differences between the TSCs using CTOD and J-integral, the effect of choice of fracture parameter on TSC with internal pressure was not significant.

Growing evidence indicates that the results of anti-cancer drug screening vary with the cell culture microenvironment, and this variation has been proposed as a reason for the high failure rate of clinical trials. Since the culture condition-dependent drug sensitivity of anti-cancer drugs may negatively impact the identification of clinically effective drug candidates, more reliable in vitro cancer platforms are urgently needed. In this review article, we provide an overview of how cell culture conditions can alter drug efficacy and highlight the importance of developing more reliable cancer drug testing platforms for use in the drug discovery process. The environmental factors that can alter drug delivery and efficacy are reviewed. Based on these observations of chemoresistant tumor physiology, we summarize the recent advances in the fabrication of in vitro cancer models and the model-dependent cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs, with a particular focus on engineered environmental factors in these platforms.

Recent advances in wireless broadband and multimedia services have evolved PSNs extensively. Third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP-LTE) becomes a basic platform for deploying public safety networks around the world. There have been extensive studies on LTE-based PSNs satisfying mission-critical requirements. However, most studies focus on investigating PSNs with network infrastructure, and there is little progress on infrastructure-less PSNs, where base stations and network coordinators become destroyed or impaired. This paper focuses on infrastructure-less PSNs, where battery-powered individual IoT devices cooperate to construct the network without any central coordination. It is aimed at maximizing the network survival time of the IPSN while satisfying mission-critical requirements. A highly nonlinear nature of the network construction problem with several constraints renders the optimization task very challenging. In addition, no coordinator exists in IPSNs and all nodes are subject to the identification of distributed strategy to achieve the goal. To this end, a state-of-the-art message-passing framework is introduced to develop a novel distributed algorithm. The major benefit originates from the controllability of the limit on wireless link hops to meet the data reliability and transmission latency required for mission-critical IPSNs. We also establish the proof on the optimality. The proposed technique converges rapidly and keeps the computation load per IoT device low, which makes it attractive for practical implementation. Simulation results verify that the proposed approach outperforms various existing approaches considerably and consistently. © 2013 IEEE.","Distributed algorithm; Internet-of-Things; message-passing algorithm; public safety network; spanning tree with hop limit","Long Term Evolution (LTE); Message passing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia services; Parallel algorithms; Trees (mathematics); Wireless telecommunication systems; 3rd generation partnership project; Distributed strategies; Internet of Things (IOT); Message passing algorithm; Network coordinators; Network infrastructure; Public Safety Networks; Spanning tree; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056731523

However, there was the floating issue of void foamer such that it does not exhibit enough structural performance as comparing to the solid slab section. The goal of this study is to evaluate flexural capacity of reinforced concrete void slab with rectangular-shaped steel pipe for protecting the buoyancy of void foamer. A series of experiments were conducted and the critical variables of specimen were the directional arrangement and the continuity of the segmented steel pipe. According to these experimental results, it has shown that steel pipe contributed to the change of flexural strength of void slab. In addition, the specimen with steel pipe has a longitudinal placement and segmented arrangement is more beneficial than that of transverse directional placement. Calculated flexural capacity by existing formular was under-estimated than that of experimental measurement. Therefore, it has shown that a new equation to evaluate flexural strength of void slab is required depending on the critical variables such as the continuity and length of the steel pipe. © 2018 by Korea Concrete Institute.","Flexural behavior; Polystyrene void foamer; Steel for buoyancy protection; Steel pipe; Void slab",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055756965

The C-GFB consists of a laminated top foil, bump foil, and piezo stacks and can simply change the bearing shape or film thickness locally and globally by varying the thickness of the piezo stacks by adjusting the input voltage. The working method of C-GFBs is as follows. First, the bearing clearance is adjusted by changing the overall piezo stack thickness (clearance control). Second, the bearing preload (preload control) is modulated by the thickness expansion of several piezo stacks. Bearing lubrication performance is predicted for four cases of C-GFBs that controlled to have different bearing clearances and preloads. The piezo stack control generates meaningful differences in the fluid-film thickness and pressure. Clearance control has a great effect on the dynamic force coefficients, but preload control slightly increases the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients. Furthermore, the rotordynamic prediction of a rotor supported on two journal C-GFBs is conducted. As a result, both control mode for C-GFB is found to have a positive effect on rotordynamic performance in terms of synchronous motions. Finally, the C-GFB is controlled to have a small bearing clearance and large preload at critical speeds to make it possible to stably pass through the critical speeds. Consequently, it turns out that the C-GFB can generate meaningful performance change in terms of bearing lubrication and rotordynamic performances by controlling only the input voltage of the piezo stacks. In addition, the C-GFB can be used to form various shapes to meet the operation conditions of an applied system.

However, concrete has been pointed out that it consumes a large volume of energy and emits a lot of carbon dioxide during its manufacturing. In order to lower such environmental burdens of concrete structures, a number of studies and approaches have been carried out. The voided slab is also suggested as a new method to reduce the environmental burden since voided section of the slab would use less concrete compared with the normal reinforced concrete slab. However, no studies have evaluated the CO2 emissions and environmental performance of voided slabs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the structural performance of voided slabs and empirically corroborate their environmental influence. The flexural performance test was carried out based on the variables of the depth of slab, types of the void former materials, and the hollowness ratio. In addition, comparison of the emission of CO2 was also performed by considering the hollowness ratio and types of void former materials over the normal reinforced concrete slab. The structural performance of the voided slab was similar or slightly higher than the normal reinforced concrete slab. The yield strength of specimens was increased approximately 10∼30% over the anticipated yield strength. Based on this result, it is considered that the voided slab would be sufficient to structural performance and beneficial to plane planning in buildings. In general, it is considered that the voided slab would be beneficial to both structural and environmental aspects. However, the test results in this research showed that the voided slab would emit more carbon dioxide emissions compared to the normal reinforced concrete slab. The main source of more CO2 emissions in the voided slab was the anchoring materials. In this research, wires were used to fix the void former materials to the reinforcing bars. In order for the voided slab to become a more eco-friendly and sustainable material, new anchoring methods such as use of recycled materials, new void former materials without anchoring, or other eco-friendly materials should be applied to reduce the emission of CO2. © 2018 Seungho Cho and Seunguk Na.",,"Bars (metal); Carbon dioxide; Compressive strength; Concrete beams and girders; Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Global warming; Reinforced concrete; Reinforcement; Structural analysis; Tensile strength; Yield stress; Carbon dioxide emissions; Eco-friendly materials; Environmental aspects; Environmental influences; Environmental performance; High-tensile strength; Structural performance; Sustainable materials; Concrete slabs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053415828

The parameters of reinforced concrete reinforcement were determined as the diameter, type of anchor and embedded depth. The concrete compressive strengths used in this experiment were 21, 24 and 27 MPa which are generally used on construction sites. Reinforcing steel bars of D13, D16 and D22 diameters were also used and the strengths and failure modes were investigated in these different conditions. The following conclusions were drawn from the experimental results. The experimental results for the D22 reinforcing bar showed that anchors can be designed and fabricated in a balanced manner when the ratio of the reinforcing bars to the cross-sectional area of the concrete is maintained above 0.95%. The increase in the cross-sectional area of reinforced concrete as compared with the surface area of reinforced concrete is about 2 or 3 times. This suggests that in order to increase the tensile strength of reinforcing bars, a method to optimize the landfill depth rather than the diameter of the reinforcing steel bar can easily be applied on construction sites. © Medwell Journals, 2018.","Concrete compressive strength; Cross-sectional; Embedded rebar; Reinforcing anchor; Steel; Supporting structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052971999

The proposed control scheme is constructed based on the internal model (IM) principle in which a full-state feedback controller is used for the purpose of stabilization and the integral terms as well as resonant terms are augmented into a control structure for the reference tracking and harmonic compensation, respectively. Additionally, the proposed scheme is implemented in the synchronous reference frame (SRF) to take advantage of the simultaneous compensation for both the negative and positive sequence harmonics by one resonant term. Since this leads to the decrease of necessary resonant terms by half, the computation effort of the controller can be reduced. With regard to the full-state feedback control approach for the LCL-filtered grid connected inverter, additional sensing devices are normally required to measure all of the system state variables. However, this causes a complexity in hardware and high implementation cost for measurement devices. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a discrete-time current full-state observer that uses only the information from the control input, grid-side current sensor, and grid voltage sensor to estimate all of the system state variables with a high precision. Finally, an optimal linear quadratic control approach is introduced for the purpose of choosing optimal feedback gains, systematically, for both the controller and full-state observer.

Prussian blue (PB) can adsorb selectively to cesium (Cs), which is high in adsorption efficiency, but has a disadvantage that it is difficult to recover after adsorption, so there is a high concern about secondary environmental pollution. Therefore, this study modified the surface of powder activated carbon (PAC) particles by using covalent organic polymer (COP) for stable immobilization of PB, and developed a PB-impregnated adsorbent (COP-PAC-PB). Synthesis of COP-PAC-PB was performed by sequentially reacting with iron (III) chloride and potassium ferrocyanide solution to synthesize PB in COP pore (In-situ). The maximum adsorption of COP-PAC-PB on cesium was 19 mg/g and the removal efficiency for radioactivity cesium (Cs-137, 60 Bq/kg) was 97.3%. In addition, PB was synthesized by the same method as that of COP-PAC-PB, which is a modification product of the unmodified group (PAC, Ox-PAC), and UV-vis analysis was performed to compare PB desorption characteristics after washing Respectively. In the unmodified group (PAC-PB, Ox-PAC-PB), a large amount of PB was desorbed when washed once to 6 times. In the case of COP-PAC-PB, it was not. As a result, the surface of the PAC particles was effectively modified using COP, and the adsorbent with Prussian blue stably immobilized was developed. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Activated carbon; Covalent organic polymers(COPs); Cs-137; Prussian blue; Radioactive adsorption","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Cesium; Chlorine compounds; Desorption; Efficiency; Iron compounds; Organic carbon; Potassium chloride; Radiation; Radioactivity; Adsorption efficiency; Covalent organic polymers(COPs); Desorption characteristics; Environmental pollutions; Potassium ferrocyanide; Powder activated carbon; Prussian blue; Removal efficiencies; Organic polymers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052739258

There are very few research results using field measurement to estimate long-term behavior of railway embankments. In this study, field measurements were conducted on over-20-meter-high railway embankments for which large and long-term residual settlement after track construction were expected.

The measured earth pressure and Rankine earth pressure showed a lot of differences, whereas the measured earth pressure and silo earth pressure appeared similar because the lateral earth pressure decreases non-linearly with depth. Therefore, the most similar case to the measured lateral earth pressure distribution was derived by changing the geotechnical properties to estimate the silo earth pressure.

This function turns off the engine when the vehicle is stopped. It helps to improve the fuel efficiency by reducing fuel waste by idling. However, if you turn off the engine at a stop, the mechanical oil pump(MOP) and the flow will also stop. For this reason, the flow rate required for the power circulation is supplied through the electric oil pump(EOP), and power loss occurs. Power loss through the use of additional oil pumps affects fuel economy, as well as the capacity of the oil pump used. Therefore, power loss through the use of an oil pump must be considered in a fuel economy analysis. In this study, the fuel consumption analysis was performed while considering the power loss of the oil pump by using the backward simulation. To do this, we modeled a hypothetical mild hybrid vehicle and proceeded in assuming a hydraulic line. The study is based on the analysis of the fuel consumption reduction of the vehicle model with the idle stop and go function disregarding the oil pump loss, and the vehicle model using the mechanical oil pump and the electric oil pump. We also analyzed the changes in the engine and motor operating points.

Various parts of N. fruticans has been used as a traditional medicinal plant. However, the physiological activities of N. fruticans has not yet been clarified well. Therefore, in this study, the 50% ethanol extract and its aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions of young shoots of N. fruticans were investigated for their antioxidant, cytoprotective effect, and antimicrobial activities. Every sample possessed very high free radical and various ROS scavenging capacities assessed by employing different in vitro assays such as DPPH·, O2 ·−, ·OH, and1O2 scavenging activities. Based on these results, the cytoprotective effect was investigated using the oxidative hemolysis of erythrocyte. We found that the extract and fractions provide a greater protective effect compared with (+)-α-tocopherol. Furthermore, antimicrobial activities were confirmed against skin pathogens by broth microdilution assay. The ethyl acetate fraction had much higher antimicrobial activities than methyl paraben against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. Taken together, our results indicated that the young shoots of N. fruticans may have the potential role as a natural active ingredient through their antioxidant, cytoprotective effect, and antimicrobial activities. © 2018, Korean Society of Pharmacognosy.

To improve the stability of the NiCrAl alloy foam, oxygen concentration of microwave annealing to form a needle-like NiO layer with good chemical stability and corrosion resistance is controlled in a range of 20 and 50 %. As the oxygen concentration increases to 50 %, needle-like NiO forms a dense coating layer on the NiCrAl alloy foam; this layer formation can be attributed to accelerated growth of the (200) plane. In addition, the increased oxygen concentration causes increased NiO/Ni ratio of the resultant coating layer on NiCrAl alloy foam due to improved rate of the oxidation reaction. As a result, the introduction of dense needle-like NiO layers formed at 50 % oxygen concentration improves the chemical stability of the NiCrAl alloy foam by protecting the direct electrochemical reaction between the electrolyte and the foam. Thus, needle-like NiO can be proposed as a superb protecting layer to improve the chemical stability of NiCrAl alloy form. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Electroplating; Microwave annealing; NiCrAl alloy foam; NiO protecting layer; Oxygen concentration","Annealing; Chemical stability; Chromium alloys; Coatings; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Electrolytes; Electroplating; Hydrogen production; Microwave heating; Needles; Nickel oxide; Oxygen; Ternary alloys; Coating layer; Electrochemical reactions; Electroplated Ni; Layer formation; Microwave annealing; Oxidation reactions; Oxygen concentrations; Protecting layer; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050332755

The study was motivated by a recent increase in the demand for quadruped walking robots capable of safe locomotion on rough terrains typical of disaster regions. To overcome the challenges of such rough terrains, a robot's dynamic stability must be maintained irrespective of the ground slope or external forces; hence, a posture stabilization algorithm for quadruped walking is required. In this study, we first performed the body-balance control for disturbances using an inverted pendulum model; then, we conducted the foot-landing position control using a cart-inverted pendulum model. We built a framework for the posture stabilization algorithm by combining the above two controllers and consequently verified the performance of the posture stabilization of our quadruped walking robot in the presence of external forces and on a slope using the Webots dynamics simulator. © 2018 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Cart-Inverted Pendulum Model; Posture Stabilization; Quadruped Walking Robot(4)","Biped locomotion; Mobile robots; Pendulums; Position control; Slope stability; Balance control; Dynamics simulator; External force; Inverted pendulum model; Posture stabilization; Quadruped walking; Quadruped walking robot; Rough terrains; Stabilization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049871216

The derailment safety is evaluated by the wheel unloading criteria of the TSI in EU, considering the simultaneous effects of the crosswind and the centrifugal force on a curved track. In the case of rollingstock, because of the high inertia of the carbody and the relatively low stiffness values of the second suspensions, there are low lateral natural frequencies less than 1 Hz. It is proven using the suggested theoretical formula that the wheel unloading increases abnormally according to the elapsed time, and the risk of derailment increases when the frequency of a crosswind is same as the lateral natural frequency of the carbody and the damping coefficient is small. The theoretical estimations for the resonance frequency of the carbody are in good agreements with the simulation results within 5% deviation. © 2018 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Cyclical crosswind; Derailment safety; Rollingstock; Suspension system; Wheel unloading","Derailments; Frequency estimation; Natural frequencies; Unloading; Wheels; Cyclical crosswind; Damping coefficients; Resonance frequencies; Rollingstock; Suspension system; Theoretical estimation; Theoretical evaluation; Wheel unloading; Suspensions (components)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049696628

The spacer grid assembly has the role of protecting the fuel rod against external loads such as earthquakes and car accidents during transportation. Thus far, the protection capability of the spacer grid has been studied for only one layer of spacer grid owing to experimental and computational cost limits. Numerical analysis for the whole fuel cell assembly is very difficult because it requires the use of a very large number of elements. In particular, a very large number of elements is required to represent the spring of the spacer grid. Therefore, a simplified equivalent model that exhibits the same behavior as the original model is designed using the minimum deformation energy method. The designed equivalent model is verified using a well-known commercial code. As a result, it is shown that the computation time can be reduced by 80% using the equivalent spring model. © 2018 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Equivalent model; Minimum deformation energy; Space grid; Spring","Deformation; Nuclear fuel cladding; Nuclear reactor accidents; Springs (components); Computation time; Computational costs; Deformation energy; Equivalent model; Equivalent springs; Nuclear fuel assemblies; Protection capabilities; Space grids; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049691842

Normally, the dissemination is based on vehicular communications, of which the de-facto standard is Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC). However, due to high frequency operations, a DSRC signal is seriously attenuated when being propagated in Non Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. Previous schemes leveraged the use of centralized infrastructures or relay vehicles enabling a safety message to bypass large obstacles. However, implementing the infrastructures in all intersections would be very costly; one may not find proper relay vehicles in low density, and frequent rebroadcasts cause serious network congestion in high density. To address this challenge, we propose a novel scheme that exploits excellent propagation characteristics of a TV White Space (TVWS) band (in addition to a DSRC band) for reliable dissemination in NLOS intersections. To ensure reliable dissemination throughout a broad range of densities without infrastructures, our scheme employs two innovative mechanisms: a collaborative procedure and a Dynamic optimal Configuration (DoC).

Digital forensics of mobile third-party applications can provide important evidence to forensics investigators. However, most mobile operating systems are now updated on a frequent basis, and developers are constantly releasing new versions of them. For these reasons, forensic investigators experience difficulties in finding the locations and meanings of data during digital investigations. Therefore, this paper presents scenario-based methods of forensic analysis for a specific third-party social networking service application on a specific mobile device. When applied to certain third-party applications, digital forensics can provide forensic investigators with useful data for the investigation process. The main purpose of the forensic analysis proposed in the present paper is to determine whether the general use of third-party applications leaves data in the mobile internal storage of mobile devices and whether such data are meaningful for forensic purposes. © KIPS.","Digital investigation; Forensics; Mobile; Third-party applications","Computer crime; Digital storage; Electronic crime countermeasures; Mobile devices; Social networking (online); Digital investigation; Forensics; Forensics investigators; Mobile; Mobile operating systems; Social networking applications; Social networking services; Third party application (Apps); Digital forensics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049390564

In this study, an automatic design of porous shell structures was developed for weight reduction and better ventilation of 3D printed parts. A numerical algorithm was developed to generate porous shell structures based on finite element mesh. The effects of mesh size and hole diameter were investigated in terms of the quality of the porous structures, and an algorithm to determine hole diameter was proposed to generate holes adaptively according to the target geometry and the relevant mesh density.

To meet this demand, it is necessary to increase the durability of bellows, which secure vacuum condition and assist moving parts of the VI. The bellows are made by brazing welding of stainless-steel sheets. These are generally plated with nickel to improve brazing performance; however, Ni-plating may cause deformation of physical properties and reduction of operation life of the bellows. This paper suggests that the durability of the VI can be extended by skipping some of the Ni plating process for the bellows. Test results using various combinations of brazing specimens show that good brazing performance can be achieved even when some nickel plating processes are skipped; durability test using bellows sample indicates that the lifespan of the bellows can be extended by more than 10%. © 2018 The Korean Society for Railway.

Settlement can cause problems such as reduced train stability, and increased cost and time of maintenance. The Gyeongsang Basin, which include Daegu, Gyeongju, and Ulsan, was constructed using rock debris of tunnel excavation as embankment material. It is mainly composed of shale rock. This shale, which weathers faster in this area, is very easily weathered and breaks along the bedding planes when exposed to wind and rain after a certain period. For this reason, cracks and fractures of the concrete tracks have occurred due to roadbed settlement. In this study, field measurement was conducted to study settlement of the shale rock fill. Also, problems in an existing slake durability test were analyzed for shale, which may be unsuitable as an embankment material. A new test method for shale was conducted and proposed.

Previous studies in the literature found that in general, bicycling is affected by weather conditions and temporal characteristics. However, the degrees of impacts or the signs of effects may be different depending on the stations. Therefore, this study investigated the different effects of weather conditions and temporal characteristics according to the characteristics of the stations at the station level analysis in addition to the system level analysis. For the cost-effective station level analysis, clustering analysis was utilized to find out the groups of the stations with the similar properties. Moreover, temperature humidity index (THI) and the indicator variable of heatwaves were introduced to consider the interaction between temperature and humidity and measure the influence of high temperature, which has been rarely considered. In the system level analysis, the results showed that the selected factors have the different influence over the different time periods within a day. Especially, scorching heat and non-working days differently affect the demand for public bikes by hours. Also, it was observed that high temperature over 30 °C reduces the bicycle usage, which revealed the necessity of taking into account not only severe colds but also heatwaves in the prediction of the demand. By clustering analysis, the stations were partitioned into the three clusters. One cluster shows the strong peak in the morning while two others have peaks in the evening. The effects of weather conditions and non-working days on the demand for public bicycles were different depending on the clusters, which seemed to be related to the main purposes of bike usage in the clusters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering analysis; Negative binomial regression analysis; Public bicycle system","cluster analysis; cycle transport; public transport; regression analysis; transportation system; travel behavior; weather; South Korea; Taejon [South Korea]; Taejon [Taejon (ADS)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044844639

The indirect current control has been proposed to provide not only a stable voltage to critical loads during clearing time but also a seamless transfer of inverters at the instant of a mode change. However, the conventional islanding detection methods cannot be applied to the indirect current control based inverter since the magnitude and frequency of voltage do not vary when an islanding occurs. This paper proposes a reactive power P&O anti-islanding method for the indirect current control. The proposed islanding detection method generates a small reactive power perturbation at the output of the inverter and detects the islanding by observing reactive power mismatch during the islanding. Using the proposed method, the inverter can supply high quality power to critical loads without distorting the output current during the clearing time. The proposed anti-islanding method is validated through simulation and experimental results. © 2012 IEEE.","Critical load; indirect current control; inverter; islanding; reactive power; seamless transfer","Capacitors; Electric current control; Electric inductors; Electric inverters; Reactive power; Voltage control; Critical load; Indirect current control; inverter; Islanding; Seamless transfer; Distributed power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044315575

The WSN demands an efficient power management due to limited energy resources of the nodes and it can be achieved by implementing the energy efficient protocols. Hierarchy based protocols are recognized to be energy efficient. One of the most widely known hierarchical protocols is the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). However, the cluster head distribution in LEACH is only based on the probability which is preset at the beginning of working procedure. Consequently, it can lead to the unbalance in selecting the cluster head in regard of the position. Numerous research focus on wisely distributing the cluster head position to achieve the prolonged lifetime of the network. In this study, we propose a modification of the LEACH protocol. It is expected that the proposed protocol can extend the lifetime of the system by incorporating the transmission distance between the network area and the data sink.

In order to inject fuel under conditions identical to those when driving a vehicle, various vehicles' sensor signals on an identical level to the driving condition were input to the ECU of the device. When the various vehicles' sensor signals are supplied to the ECU, the ECU drives the injector in a manner equivalent to the vehicle running condition. The vehicle performance parameters under the vehicle driving conditions were computer simulated using GT-Suite®. Vehicle specifications including the engine part load data, a vehicle automatic transmission shift map, the K-factor and torque ratio data of the torque converter, and the transmission gear ratio were used as input data for the GT-Power® simulation. In this study, FTP-75 served as the vehicle driving mode. The vehicle performance parameters simulated by GT-Suite® were the throttle opening angle, intake air flow rate, and the engine speed. Various sensor signals based on the vehicle performance parameters were generated by the FPGA board and real-time OS. When these various sensor signals generated by the FPGA board are supplied to the ECU, the injectors driven by the ECU inject fuel into each collecting chamber. A load cell and a dynamic strain amplifier were used to measure the cumulative amount of fuel injected at 0.05 second intervals after the driving of the injectors started. The cumulative amount of fuel injected while driving the ECU in the Phase I section (0-512 seconds) of the FTP- 75 mode was measured and the experiment was repeated 20 times. The average and standard deviation of the cumulative amount of injected fuel were determined at each of the measurement time steps during Phase I. Moreover, an uncertainty analysis of the experimental data was conducted using the t-distribution error function. The cumulative injected fuel quantities measured at 0.05 second intervals were distributed within 2% of the mean value at a 95% confidence level. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Cumulative injected fuel mass; FTP-75; Gasoline injector; Transient fuel injection rate; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle driving mode",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040618565

An open-switch fault is usually initiated by an accidental over-current, or electrical and thermal stresses. This fault may induce crucial secondary damage in the drive system since it is easily propagated and produces a continuous harmful effect on other system components. The open-switch faults in inverters often occur in a very complicated manner. Due to this reason, it was only recently that real-time diagnosis schemes under the open-switch faults in multiple switches have been presented in a few references. However, to alleviate the complexity and exactness issues, most of the conventional diagnosis schemes have considered the open faults only in two simultaneous switches until now, which is not generally the case. Even though the fault detection is simple and immediate, the exact fault localization is not a simple task, especially when there are open faults in three simultaneous switches because different open-switch fault locations may develop the same fault signature. To deal with such a problem, free-wheeling mode detection is introduced in this paper for the purpose of identifying the exact fault group and the faulty switch location. Then main objective of this paper is to realize a reliable fault localization algorithm under the condition of simultaneous open-switches (up to three) on an online basis without requiring any extra hardware or sensors in order that the algorithm can be easily installed in main CPU of a commercial drive system. For this purpose, the open faults in simultaneous switches are categorized into seven different fault groups. The entire system is implemented on a digital controller by using TMS320F28335 digital signal processor (DSP). The experimental results are presented under various open fault conditions to validate the usefulness of the proposed open-switch fault localization scheme. © 2018 by the authors.","Free-wheeling mode detection; PWM inverter; Reliable on-line fault localization; Seven fault groups; Three simultaneous open-switches","Digital signal processors; Electric inverters; Permanent magnets; Pulse width modulation; Synchronous machinery; Time switches; Voltage control; Digital Signal Processor (DSP); Line faults; Mode detection; Permanent magnet synchronous machine drive systems; Pulse width modulation inverters; PWM inverter; Real-time diagnosis; Seven fault groups; Fault detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040309112

Usually, it is composed of a camera and a laser which projects a line on the target. Calibration is necessary to acquire 3D information using structured light stripe vision system. Conventional calibration algorithms have found the pose of the camera and the equation of the stripe plane of the laser under the same coordinate system of the camera. Therefore, the 3D reconstruction is only possible under the camera frame. In most cases, this is sufficient to fulfill given tasks. However, they require multiple images which are acquired under different poses for calibration. In this paper, we propose a calibration algorithm that could work by using just one shot. Also, proposed algorithm could give 3D reconstruction under both the camera and laser frame. This would be done by using newly designed calibration structure which has multiple vertical planes on the ground plane. The ability to have 3D reconstruction under both the camera and laser frame would give more flexibility for its applications.

However, there have been no established methods to study the mass balance of major landfill elements, excluding some studies focused on specific target materials. In this study, different landfill management methodologies were used to conduct mass balance analysis of three major elements at Sudokwon Landfill Site 2 (LS2) in South Korea during 2001–2014. The results indicated that biochemically decomposable carbon accounted for 38.2% of the total landfill organic carbon content. Further, 51.3% of this decomposable fraction underwent decomposition during the research period, 99.0% of which was emitted in landfill gas as CO2 and CH4. In terms of sulfur, 6.1% of the total decomposed sulfur was emitted as H2S (97.0%), and almost all of the total decomposed nitrogen was emitted (5.7%) in leachate as NH4 +-N. LS2 had a low decomposition rate due to the dryness of the landfill site and the increasing ratio of demolition waste, which does not decompose easily. Therefore, thermochemical energy recovery before waste disposal and leachate recycling seem to be necessary. In terms of leachate recycling, economic measures to prevent nitrogen accumulation may be required in the long term. Additionally, for suppressing H2S generation, separate disposal of waste soil produced throughout the course of mechanical pretreatment of demolition waste should be conducted. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemical decomposition; Elemental analysis; Landfill gas; Leachate; Mass balance; Surface emission","Bioassay; Biogas; Chemical analysis; Demolition; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Recycling; Sulfur; Biochemical decomposition; Landfill gas; Leachates; Mass balance; Surface emissions; Leachate treatment; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; organic carbon; sulfur; biochemistry; decomposition; demolition; landfill; leachate; mass balance; nitrogen; sulfur; waste disposal; waste management; analytic method; Article; chemical analysis; decomposition; environmental management; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; landfill; leaching; mass balance analysis; mathematical computing; nitrogen metabolism; priority journal; South Korea; waste disposal facility; chemistry; soil; waste disposal; water pollutant; South Korea; Nitrogen; Refuse Disposal; Republic of Korea; Soil; Waste Disposal Facilities; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035059822

The technique utilizes the fact that when the vibration frequency of the object is significantly higher than the frame rate of the imaging device, the interference term can be approximated by the lowest (0th) order of the first kind Bessel function. Since the 0th order Bessel function takes the maximum value of unity when the vibration amplitude is null, the amplitude of a given vibration can be estimated from the reduction of the interference term relative to the case when the object is still. In reality, however, various environmental noises, such as temperature fluctuation of air in the interferometric paths and floor motion transferred through the optical table, cause low frequency fluctuations of the interference term, and thereby compromise the integrity of data. In this paper, we discuss typical environmental noise on standard optical interferometer settings, and propose to reduce the effect of the noise on the signal by introducing a carrier fringe system and analyzing the fringe pattern in the spatial frequency domain.

Over the last few decades, hundreds of drought indices have been developed in order to improve monitoring and impact assessment. For a particular drought event, these multiple indices sometimes indicate different levels of drought severity, creating confusion among stakeholders and posing challenges for decision making. To overcome the problem, this study suggests a novel methodology using a Bayesian network. There are several advantages of this proposed method: (1) it pools information from multiple drought indices and comes up with a better estimate for drought severity; (2) instead of a deterministic drought-severity outcome from the individual indices, it offers probabilistic estimates for drought severity; and (3) it reduces the uncertainty of the individual drought indices. The robustness of the methodology is further checked with a case study of an actual drought event in South Korea. © ASCE.","Bayesian network; Drought; Standardized precipitation index","Bayesian networks; Decision making; Uncertainty analysis; Drought indices; Drought severity; Impact assessments; Multiple index; Novel methodology; Probabilistic estimates; South Korea; Standardized precipitation index; Drought; assessment method; Bayesian analysis; drought; environmental monitoring; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; standard (reference); uncertainty analysis; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032810590

By comparing experimental results with finite element analysis (FEA), the type and contribution of size effects could be identified. We found that the deformation size effect is the most pronounced in microscale coining where grains must be introduced into relatively small die cavities through severe plastic deformation. The magnitude of the deformation size effect was determined by the relative ratio of the grain size to the die cavity, and smaller size factor produced greater effect. We also found that feature height in microscale coining was related to grain size and flow stress of the material. Therefore, size effects could be quantitatively modeled and compensated by calculating equivalent grain size and flow stress correction.

However, to manage these huge data stores, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage cannot afford auspicious way. There are many challenges that must be addressed in the traditional network architecture due to the rapid growth in the diversity and number of devices connected to the internet, which is not designed to provide high availability, real-time data delivery, scalability, security, resilience, and low latency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based distributed cloud architecture with a software defined networking (SDN) enable controller fog nodes at the edge of the network to meet the required design principles. The proposed model is a distributed cloud architecture based on blockchain technology, which provides low-cost, secure, and on-demand access to the most competitive computing infrastructures in an IoT network. By creating a distributed cloud infrastructure, the proposed model enables cost-effective high-performance computing. Furthermore, to bring computing resources to the edge of the IoT network and allow low latency access to large amounts of data in a secure manner, we provide a secure distributed fog node architecture that uses SDN and blockchain techniques. Fog nodes are distributed fog computing entities that allow the deployment of fog services, and are formed by multiple computing resources at the edge of the IoT network. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with the existing models using various performance measures. The results of our evaluation show that performance is improved by reducing the induced delay, reducing the response time, increasing throughput, and the ability to detect real-time attacks in the IoT network with low performance overheads. © 2017 IEEE.","blockchain; cloud computing; edge computing; fog computing; Internet of things; security; software defined networking","Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Fog; Information management; Internet of things; Network architecture; Network function virtualization; Network security; Software defined networking; Block-chain; Distributed database; Edge computing; Peer-to-peer computing; Performance evaluation; Security; Distributed computer systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030782546

Therefore, the Korean government has planned to expand FC power generation from 565 GWh in 2013 to 13,449 GWh by 2027. This article aims to assess the public value or acceptability of this expansion in terms of reducing CO2 emissions. To this end, we derive the public's additional willingness to pay (WTP) for the expansion using a contingent valuation survey of 1000 Korean households. For the purpose of mitigating the response effect in eliciting their WTP and increasing statistical efficiency in analyzing the WTP data, we employ a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question format. Furthermore, we use the spike model so as to model zero WTP responses. The mean additional monthly WTP for the expansion is computed to be KRW 1407 (USD 1.37) per household. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 310.5 billion (USD 304.4 million) per year. We can conclude that Korean households are ready to shoulder some of the financial burden of expanding FC power generation to reduce CO2 emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Fuel cell power generation; Spike model; Willingness to pay","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Expansion; Resource valuation; Contingent valuations; Fuel cell power generation; Korean Government; Public values; Spike models; State of the art; Statistical efficiency; Willingness to pay; Fuel cells",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026457189

The particles generated by abrasion during subway operations and the vehicle-emitted pollutants flowing in from the street in particular affect the air quality in underground subway stations. Thus the continuous monitoring of particulate matter (PM) in underground station is important to evaluate the exposure level of PM to passengers. However, it is difficult to obtain indoor PM data because the measurement systems are expensive and difficult to install and operate for significant periods of time in spaces crowded with people. In this study, we predicted the indoor PM concentration using the information of outdoor PM, the number of subway trains running, and information on ventilation operation by the artificial neural network (ANN) model. As well, we investigated the relationship between ANN's performance and the depth of underground subway station. ANN model showed a high correlation between the predicted and actual measured values and it was able to predict 67 ∼ 80% of PM at 6 subway station.

In order to improve their transparent conducting performances, we carried out oxygen activation by adjusting the ratio of O2/(O2+N2) in the carrier gas (0%, 20%, and 50%) used during the deposition process. The oxygen activation on the FTO electrodes accelerated the substitution concentration of F (FO•) into the oxygen sites in the FTO electrode while the oxygen vacancy (VO••) concentration was reduced. In addition, due to growth of pyramid-shaped crystallites with (200) preferred orientations, this oxygen activation caused the formation of a uniform surface structure. As a result, compared to others, the FTO electrode prepared at 50% O2 showed excellent electrical and optical properties (sheet resistance of ∼4.0 ± 0.14 ω/□, optical transmittance of ∼85.3%, and figure of merit of ∼5.09 ± 0.19 × 10-2 ω-1). This led to a superb photoconversion efficiency (∼7.03 ± 0.20%) as a result of the improved short-circuit current density. The photovoltaic performance improvement can be defined by the decreased sheet resistance of FTO used as a transparent conducting electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which is due to the combined effect of the high carrier concentration by the improved FO• concentration on the FTO electrodes and the fasted Hall mobility by the formation of a uniform FTO surface structure and distortion relaxation on the FTO lattices resulting from the reduced VO••• concentration. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","film structures; fluorine-doped tin oxide; horizontal ultrasonic spray pyrolysis deposition; oxygen activation; photovoltaic performance; transparent conducting electrode","Carrier concentration; Chemical activation; Deposition; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electrodes; Fluorine; Hall mobility; Nanocomposites; Optical properties; Oxygen; Photovoltaic effects; Pyrolysis; Sheet resistance; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Spray pyrolysis; Surface structure; Tin; Tin oxides; Conducting performance; Electrical and optical properties; Fluorine doped tin oxide; Photoconversion efficiency; Photovoltaic performance; Preferred orientations; Transparent conducting electrodes; Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038614546

Methods The effects of EABTO on melanin synthesis in B16F1 cells and human epidermal melanocytes and the influence on cell-free tyrosinase activity were evaluated. EABTO-induced cellular signaling cascades were studied by western blotting. Key findings EABTO effectively decreased melanin synthesis in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on cell-free tyrosinase activity. EABTO significantly decreased the expression of melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1), and TRP-2. EABTO decreased the amounts of phosphorylated cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thereby inhibiting expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Moreover, EABTO upregulated phosphorylated ERK. A specific ERK pathway inhibitor, PD98059, reduced EABTO-induced ERK phosphorylation and restored the expression of MITF and melanin content. Significance EABTO inhibits melanogenesis in B16F1 melanoma cells via suppression of the cAMP–CREB pathway and activation of ERK, thus decreasing expression of MITF and of melanogenic enzymes. © 2017","ERK; Melanogenesis; MITF; Syringic-acid derivative; Tyrosinase","2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; alpha intermedin; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; dermatological agent; dopachrome tautomerase; ethyl 2 acetamido 3 (4 hydroxy 3,5 di methoxybenzoylthio)propanoate; melanin; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; mitogen activated protein kinase; monophenol monooxygenase; syringic acid; tyrosinase related protein 1; unclassified drug; acetylcysteine; alpha intermedin; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; ethyl 2-acetamido-3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoylthio)propanoate; gallic acid; melanin; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; monophenol monooxygenase; oxidoreductase; tyrosinase-related protein-1; Article; B16-F1 cell line; concentration response; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug structure; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; epidermis cell; hormone action; human; human cell; melanocyte; melanogenesis; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; upregulation; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; cell line; drug effects; MAPK signaling; melanoma; metabolism; mouse; tumor cell line; Acetylcysteine; alpha-MSH; Animals; Biosynthetic Pathways; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Gallic Acid; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Melanins; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Mice; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Oxidoreductases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031107077

To find the optimum condition of Al2O3 coating layer and Al doping, we performed the simple calcination methods at 300 °C using the Al(OH)2-coated LMO NPs. The resultant Al2O3-coated LAMO NPs exhibited the highest capacity of 111.1 mAh g−1 with the capacity retention of 94.4% after 90 cycles at 1 C, excellent rate performance, and the highest high-rate capacity of 81.4 mAh g−1 at 10 C as compared to bare LMO NPs without Al2O3 coating and Al(OH)2-coated LMO NPs without calcination. The improved electrochemical performance can be defined by the co-effect of Al2O3 coating and Al doping on bare LMO NPs. The former is related to cycle stability that increased due to the prevention of volume expansion and Mn dissolution as a physical buffer layer. The latter is related to high-rate performance improved due to the enhanced bonding energy of Al–O bond. Therefore, it can be concluded that Al2O3-coated LAMO NPs are promising candidate cathode materials for high-performance LIBs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum doping; Aluminum oxide coating; High-rate performance; Li-ion batteries; Lithium aluminum manganese oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028464437

It can be realized via employing energy-efficient modulation and demodulation mechanisms. Specifically, a threshold-based demodulation method integrated with signal smoothing has generally been employed for backscatter communications. However, previous proposals considering a single threshold to differentiate one and zero bits from received signals have a limitation that a receiver can decode only a single bit for each demodulation attempt. Since existing Wi-Fi transceivers provide at most one RSS value per received frame, this limitation restricts the link capacity significantly. To address this limitation, we propose a simple but novel mechanism that adopts multi-leveling for Wi-Fi backscatter communications. Through computer simulation, we reveal that multi-leveling is effective in terms of BER and throughput. © 2017 IEEE.","Ambient backscatter communication; multiple thresholds; Wi-Fi backscatter","Backscattering; Demodulation; Energy efficiency; Optical variables measurement; Demodulation method; Energy efficient; Link capacities; Multiple threshold; Received signals; RF signal; Signal smoothing; Single-bit; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046903434

By controlling the optimized weight ratio of camphene on the WO3 films, we developed a unique film structure of the WO3 phase with both mesoporous morphology and oxygen vacancy defects due to the distinctive effect of camphene. The mesoporous WO3 films with oxygen vacancy defects fabricated using 10 wt% camphene showed superb multifunctional electrochromic (EC) properties with both fast switching speeds (5.8 s for coloration speed and 1.0 s for bleaching speed) and high coloration efficiency (CE, 51.4 cm2 C-1), which include the most prominent properties, particularly for switching speeds among WO3-based films reported so far. The attractive EC properties are due to the synergistic effects of the mesoporous morphology and oxygen vacancy defects on the WO3. The fast switching speeds are mainly caused by the reduced Li+ diffusion pathway due to the mesoporous morphology and increased electrical conductivity due to the oxygen vacancy defects. In addition, the increased CE value is due to the large transmittance modulation as a result of a more effective electrostatic contact of the mesoporous morphology and an increased optical bandgap of the oxygen vacancy defects on the WO3. Therefore, this unique film structure of the mesoporous WO3 films with oxygen vacancy defects can be potentially regarded as a novel EC material for high-performance EC devices. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Camphene; Defects; Electrochromic devices; Electrochromism; Mesoporous materials; Morphology; Oxygen; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Speed; Switching; Vacancies; Coloration efficiencies; Diffusion pathways; Electrical conductivity; Electrochromic properties; Electrochromics; Oxygen vacancy defects; Switching speed; Synergistic effect; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035146192

The feasible working of the circuit was examined by circuit simulation using the BSIM 4.6.0 model. A distinguishable feature of the circuit is the use of floating-gate integrators that provide the compact implementation of biologically plausible relaxation time scale. This relaxation occurs on the basis of charge tunneling that mainly relies upon area-independent tunnel barrier properties (e.g. barrier width and height) rather than capacitance. The circuit simulations feature (i) weight-dependent STDP that spontaneously limits the synaptic weight growth, (ii) competitive synaptic adaptation within both unsupervised and supervised frameworks with randomly spiking neurons. The estimated power consumption is merely 34 pW, perhaps meeting one of the most crucial principles (power-efficiency) of neuromorphic engineering.

The amount of CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plant is two times larger than that from natural gas (NG)-fired power plant in the country. In this regard, the Korean government is trying to replace some amount of coal that is used for generation with NG to reduce CO2 emissions. However, the cost of NG-fired generation is about 1.25 times higher than that of coal-fired generation. Thus, the policy-makers demand information about the household willingness to pay (WTP) for the replacement to mitigate CO2 emissions. This paper applies the contingent valuation (CV) approach, and assesses the household's WTP for replacing one kWh of coal-fired power with that of NG-fired power. For this purpose, a total of 1000 South Korean households were involved in the CV survey employing a dichotomous choice question. In addition to the current electricity price, KRW 121.52 (USD 0.11) per kWh, the respondents were willing to pay KRW 25.35 (USD 0.02) per kWh. The costs of NG-fired and coal-fired generation are KRW 100.13 and 78.05, respectively, per kWh. The difference between the two is KRW 22.08 per kWh, which is smaller than the mean additional WTP (KRW25.35 per kWh). The household's additional WTP is bigger than the actual additional cost. It is concluded that the switch of power generation source from coal to NG to reduce CO2 emissions can be supported by South Korean households. © 2017 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Coal; Contingent valuation; Generation source; Natural gas; Willingness to pay","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Costs; Electric power generation; Emission control; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Resource valuation; CO2 emissions; Coal fired generation; Coal-fired power plant; Contingent valuations; Electricity prices; Generation source; Power generation sources; Willingness to pay; Fossil fuel power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044447257

This analysis was carried out to determine how significant an impact customer satisfaction in using subway had on variables, such as, safety of operation, punctuality and headway. The study was a regressive analysis that used the SPSS 18 Program and revealed that positive recognition of using subway and safety of operation will have positive (+) effects on customer satisfaction. However, punctuality was rejected since there was no impact on customer satisfaction after multiple regression analyses. Although the results revealed this lack of impact, another result was that there was a mediation effect on safety of operation between punctuality and customer satisfaction. That is, the positive cognition of passengers of the full meditation effect of safety of operation was deducted to have a positive (+) effect on the positive cognition of passengers of punctuality. This study draws the conclusion that subway companies should try to impart to customers a sense of trust in the safety of operation and supply them with a variety of types of operation.

By combining advantage of steel tube and concrete, CFT has more superior deformation capacity and strength than reinforced concrete and steel structure, since bond stress between steel tube and concrete has influence on prevention of local buckling and increase in strength of concrete. For such a reason, CFT has been applied to as columns in buildings, and pile and drilled shaft foundations. CFT drilled shaft is designed to large diameter due to large local shear strength by seismic load, liquefaction and lateral spreading of soil layer. However, it brings uneconomical design by the conservative shear equation of current design provision. Until today, shear studies of circular CFT to improve shear equation have been rarely conducted and they are limited to small scale test. In this research, the numerical and experimental results are compared to current shear design equations, with the ultimate goal to serve as an initial analytical study that aids in planning further experimental and analytical research on shear resistance and behavior of circular CFT, which leads to improved shear design equations. © 2017, Korean Society of Steel Construction and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bond stress; concrete filled steel tube; finite element model; shear strength","Beams and girders; Composite structures; Concretes; Finite element method; Piles; Reinforced concrete; Shaft sinking; Shear flow; Shear strength; Soil liquefaction; Soils; Tubes (components); Tubular steel structures; Analytical research; Analytical studies; Bond stress; Circular concrete-filled tubes; Concrete filled steel tube; Concrete filled tubes; Deformation capacity; Strength of concrete; Structural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038832971

The speaker diaphragm has a convex-protruded feature with a rounded-rectangular shape on which a number of micro-corrugations are formed for sound quality improvement. This diaphragm has generally been manufactured out of thin TPU film using a thermoforming process, which required cycle time as long as several minutes for proper heating and cooling of the polymer film and mold. In this study, an ultrasonic thermoforming process was introduced to reduce the cycle time to fabricate the diaphragm by taking advantage of the rapid and localized heating capability of ultrasonic vibration energy. To improve the forming quality of a large diaphragm for a television speaker, infrared heating was added to the process to preheat the TPU film before the forming stage. Various processing parameters including ultrasonic thermoforming and infrared heating conditions were investigated in relation to the forming quality. As a consequence, the diaphragm could be fabricated with acceptable forming ratios (> 95 % in the band region and > 70 % in the micro-corrugations) and short cycle time (12 s).

Cultural orientation is also correlated with SDB. This study explores the ethnic differences in socially desirable responding when measuring PSM and job satisfaction in a multicultural but individualistic society like the United States. It tests the magnitude and pattern of SDB in measurements of PSM in this society as a whole, as well as the influence of ethnicity on SDB. The results of our experimental survey research show that SDB is significantly correlated with PSM measures, as well as job satisfaction. We therefore expect a spurious effect to occur in the correlational analysis. This implies that the correlation between job satisfaction and PSM is at least partly spurious due to measurement artifacts. Alternative ways to measure PSM need to be explored to control SDB. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","ethnic differences; job satisfaction; public service motivation; self-report questionnaires; social desirability bias",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033477099

This article tries to assess the environmental benefits of reducing thermal discharge through switching from nuclear power generation to combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Using a contingent valuation survey, we derive the additional willingness to pay (WTP) of 1000 households to switch the generation source from nuclear power to natural gas (NG)-based CHP in order to reduce the thermal discharge. We used the single-bounded dichotomous choice question to elicit WTP responses and employed the spike model to handle the zero WTP observations. The mean additional WTP for the switch is computed as KRW 63.9 (USD 0.06) per 1 kWh of electricity. This value has statistical significance at the 1% level and amounts to about 51% of the average price for electricity (KRW 125.1 or USD 0.1). This finding implies that the public are ready to shoulder a significant financial burden to reduce thermal discharge through switching from nuclear power to NG-based CHP.

This study was aimed at assessing the anti-photoaging effects of dehydroglyasperin C isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch on MMPs levels in HaCaT human keratinocytes and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods The cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Expression, phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of the protein were examined using ELISA, Western blot or gelatin zymography. Intracellular ROS measurement was evaluated by fluorescent ELISA and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) assay. Results In the present study, we found that dehydroglyasperin C markedly inhibited UVB-mediated expression of collagenase (MMP-1) and gelatinase (MMP-9) by inhibiting ROS generation. Dehydroglyasperin C treatment also decreased the UVB irradiation-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun phosphorylation, and c-Fos expression. In addition, the down-regulation of UVB-induced c-Jun phosphorylation caused by dehydroglyasperin C treatment was more than the down-regulation of c-Fos expression in the HaCaT human keratinocytes. Conclusion Our results indicated that dehydroglyasperin C may function as a potential anti-photoaging agent by inhibiting UVB-mediated MMPs expression via suppression of MAPK and AP-1 signaling. © 2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences","Activator protein 1; Dehydroglyasperin C; Matrix metalloproteinases; Mitogen-activated protein kinase; Reactive oxygen species","antioxidant; beta actin; collagen type 4; collagenase; dehydroglyasperin c; gelatinase; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; interstitial collagenase; matrilysin; matrix metalloproteinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; protein c jun; reactive oxygen metabolite; stromelysin; unclassified drug; benzopyran derivative; dehydroglyasperin C; gelatinase B; interstitial collagenase; MMP1 protein, human; MMP9 protein, human; protein c fos; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor AP 1; Article; cell viability; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; immunoreactivity; in vivo study; keratinocyte; MTT assay; oncogene c fos; photoaging; protein phosphorylation; solar radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; Western blotting; zymography; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; isolation and purification; metabolism; phosphorylation; radiation response; signal transduction; ultraviolet radiation; Benzopyrans; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; Humans; Keratinocytes; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factor AP-1; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033387172

Candidate nanomaterials comprise, but are not limited to, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, Ti, Mg, Al, etc. This work deals with the characterization and test of two different types of hard oxide nanoparticles as reinforce for NiAl-based anodes in molten carbonate fuel cells. Nano ceria and nano zirconia are compared each other and single cell test performances are presented. Compared to literature, the use of hard metal oxide nanoparticles allows good performance and promising perspectives with respect to the use a third alloying metal. However, nano zirconia performed slightly better than nano ceria as polarization and power curves are higher even if nano ceria has the highest mechanical properties. This means that the choice of nanoparticles to obtain improved anodes performance and properties is not trivial and a trade-off between relevant properties plays a key role. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anode; Cell test; Characterization; Nanoparticle; Performance","Biomechanics; Carbonation; Cerium oxide; Economic and social effects; Electrochemical electrodes; Gas fuel purification; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC); Molten materials; Nanoparticles; Oxide minerals; Reinforcement; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Zirconia; Alloying metals; Cell test; Electrode material; Metal oxide nanoparticles; Operating environment; Oxide nanoparticles; Performance; Reinforced particles; Anodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032280403

Therefore, past findings of climatic trend studies that did not consider LTP became a disputable issue. A study has been conducted to assess the trends in temperature and temperature extremes in Iraq in recent years (1965–2015) using both ordinary Mann-Kendal (MK) test; and the modified Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test, which can differentiate the multi-decadal oscillatory variations from secular trends. Trends in annual and seasonal minimum and maximum temperatures, diurnal temperature range (DTR), and 14 temperature-related extremes were assessed. MK test detected the significant increases in minimum and maximum temperature at all stations, where m-MK test detected at 86% and 80% of all stations, respectively. The temperature in Iraq is increasing 2 to 7 times faster than global temperature rise. The minimum temperature is increasing more (0.48–1.17 °C/decade) than maximum temperature (0.25–1.01 °C/decade). Temperature rise is higher in northern Iraq and in summer. The hot extremes particularly warm nights are increasing all over Iraq at a rate of 2.92–10.69 days/decade, respectively. On the other hand, numbers of cold days are decreasing at some stations at a rate of − 2.65 to − 8.40 days/decade.

The performance of the electrical connector directly affects the performance of an entire system. Fretting corrosion is generally recognized as an essential failure mechanism for an electrical contact. Major factors affecting the fretting corrosion include current magnitude, normal contact force, displacement amplitude, relative humidity, frequency, and temperature. In order to investigate the effect of normal forces on fretting corrosion behavior, normal forces were fixed at 1 N, 1.25 N, 1.5 N, 2 N, 2.5 N for various displacement amplitudes. Riders and flats made of 0.3 mm-thick brass sheet were coated with tin. The change of the electrical resistance was measured by applying constant current and displacement amplitudes to the upper sphere contact specimen, fixing the flat specimen. The normal force (F) shows a linear relationship with the threshold displacement amplitude (δth). When the displacement amplitude increases with increasing normal force, the plating layer was severely worn due to contact pressure. Dimples were found on the surfaces of the central part of the specimens showing infinite lifetime, suggesting that a soft metal-to-metal contact formed just before separation of the mated specimens at the end of the test. Specimens with an infinite lifetime tested under partial slip condition showed a relatively low oxygen concentration on the center of the wear surface. It is very important to design an electrical connector contact to maintain partial slip by using the information on the normal force and displacement amplitude in order to achieve infinite lifetime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electric contact; Fretting corrosion; Gross slip; Partial slip; Threshold displacement amplitude","Corrosion; Electric connectors; Electric contacts; Tin; Displacement amplitudes; Electrical connectors; Electrical resistances; Gross slip; Linear relationships; Normal contact force; Partial slip; Partial slip condition; Fretting corrosion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023618005

With the start of smartphones, new smart devices, including tablet PCs, smart TVs, smart refrigerators, and smart air conditioners, have emerged, expanding their areas from individuals to business and home. These days, smart home service has drawn a lot of attention as a human-centric service. It is the environment where home appliances and other smart devices are connected to internet in order for user service and experience. The current smart home service is simply based on wireless home network to execute the function of connected home. The service has no smart home security so that it is possible for users to suffer a financial loss caused by information leakage or home appliance hacking. Therefore, to apply smart home service to surroundings, it is necessary to take into account security of smart devices.

Through the statistical technique, the rain gage and geophone sensors are revealed as hugely selected sensors among various systems to provide an alarm.

Nonetheless, how to handle several dynamically varying security services with the mobile user's requirements efficiently is a critical problem that hinders the development of FMEC. To address this problem, we sought to introduce an approach to selecting an appropriate security service as per the mobile user requirements in FMEC. The problem of appropriate security service selection with hesitant fuzzy information is a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this paper, we introduce a soft hesitant fuzzy rough set (SHFRS) to solve multi-criteria decision making problems. SHFRS is introduced as an innovative extension of the hesitant fuzzy rough set theory by fusing it with the hesitant fuzzy soft set. We describe the inverse hesitant fuzzy soft set that defines the inverse hesitant fuzzy relation to determine the SHFRS upper and lower approximation operators of any hesitant fuzzy subset in the given set of parameters. We also present different special cases of SHFRS upper and lower approximation operators and discuss some fundamental theorems based on approximation operators. In addition, we propose a novel solution to multi-criteria decision making problems based on SHFRS. Finally, we assess the proposed solution by applying it to a real-Time multi-criteria decision making problem of appropriate security service selection for FMEC in the existence of multi-observer hesitant fuzzy information. © 2013 IEEE.","decision making; Fog and mobile-edge computing; hesitant fuzzy set; hesitant fuzzy soft set; rough set","Computation theory; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Fog; Fuzzy sets; Hafnium; Inverse problems; Mobile computing; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Set theory; Edge computing; Fuzzy soft sets; Mobile cellular networks; Mobile communications; Mobile user requirements; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Security; Upper and lower approximation; Rough set theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035812152

In recent years, storage-less sensing devices have been used to implement IoT services. They depend on delivered software from a network server to operate service functions, and IoT services are based on collected user information. Therefore, it is important to maintain trusted connections during software delivery or data transmission. If a network connection is untrustworthy, stable data transmission cannot be achieved. Untrustworthy data connections cause many problems in IoT services. Therefore, this paper proposes a software update method in trusted connection of IoT networking. The proposed method employs a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) as a long-range IoT networking technology and uses a mobile edge cloud to improve computing efficiency in an access network that consists of IoT devices with insufficient resources. In the proposed method, the mobile edge cloud is integrated into a gateway and processes sensing data and remote software updates of LPWAN. IoT devices can receive software functions from the mobile edge cloud. The proposed method analyzes statistical information about connections in an access network and determines the LPWAN trusted connections. Then, software updates can be performed over the trusted connection. Using trusted connections leads to an increased packet delivery rate and reduced transmission energy consumption. The proposed method is compared with currently available systems through computer simulation and the proposed method's efficiency is validated. © 2013 IEEE.","Internet of Thing; low power wide area network; mobile edge computing; remote software update; trusted connection","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Logic gates; Low power electronics; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Servers; Trusted computing; Wide area networks; Data-communication; Low Power; Mobile communications; Mobile Edge Computing; Remote software updates; Trusted connection; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035760346

Model Output Statistics (MOS) based downscaling models were developed using two data mining approaches known as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM was found to downscale all GCMs with normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 48.2–75.2 and skill score (SS) of 0.94–0.98 during validation. The results show that the future projection of the annual rainfalls is increasing and decreasing on the region-based and catchment-based basis due to the influence of the monsoon season affecting the coast of Sarawak. The ensemble mean of GCMs projections reveals the increased and decreased mean of annual precipitations at 33 stations with the rate of 0.1% to 19.6% and one station with the rate of − 7.9% to − 3.1%, respectively under all RCP scenarios.

An open-switch fault which often leads to secondary damage in the entire system arises due to accidental overcurrent as well as electrical and thermal stresses. Especially, the open fault in multiple switches occurs in various types of combination, which prevents a fault localization algorithm from operating reliably. To alleviate the complexity in diagnosis algorithm, this paper classifies the open faults into different categories, which enables the diagnosis algorithm to handle and identify multiple failures in switching devices in more straightforward and systematic way. The decision-making process is simple and easy due to unique fault characteristic in each group. In the proposed scheme, the fault group is simply identified from only non-zero phase current information by using the moving window-based signals instead of the entire electrical periodic data. The proposed scheme detects a fault as well as faulty switches by on-line basis without additional hardware. It is not only immune to false alarms due to inexact detection, but also independent of operating conditions. The practical usefulness of the proposed scheme is verified through the simulations and experiments. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","digital signal processor TMS320F28335; fault diagnosis; moving window; on-line fault localization; open fault in multiple switches; permanent magnet synchronous machine drive; pulse width modulation inverter; reliability","Computational complexity; Decision making; Digital signal processors; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Failure analysis; Learning algorithms; Magnets; Modulation; Permanent magnets; Pulse width modulation; Reliability; Signal processing; Synchronous machinery; Voltage control; Line faults; Moving window; Multiple switches; Permanent magnet synchronous machines; Pulse width modulation inverters; Fault detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041108700

The policy-makers need information on the environmental conservation value of the SOS for informed decision-making about the SOS. This paper attempts to measure the environmental conservation value of the SOS. To this end, the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for conserving the SOS is derived from a 2015 contingent valuation survey of 1000 Korean households comprising 400 households residing in the Saemangeum area and 600 households living in other areas. The authors employ a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question format. Moreover, the spike model is adopted to analyze the WTP data with zero observations. The mean annual WTP values for both areas are calculated to be KRW3861 (USD 3.26) and KRW3789 (USD 3.20) per household, respectively. They are statistically significant at the 1% level. When the sample is expanded to the whole country, it is worth KRW 70.9 billion (USD 59.8 million) per annum. Therefore, conserving the SOS will contribute to the Korean people's utility and can be done with public support. The value provides a useful baseline for decision-making for the SOS management. © 2017 by the authors.","Contingent valuation; Environmental conservation value; Open sea; Saemangeum; Willingness to pay","anthropogenic source; contingent valuation; decision making; development project; environmental protection; household survey; open ocean; policy making; resident population; sea wall; statistical analysis; willingness to pay; North Cholla; Saemangeum; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033709566

The proposed converter can achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of all switches in continuous current mode (CCM) under bidirectional power flow. Even though step-up/down ratio is about 3.5 times compared to the conventional half bridge converter, the voltage rating of components such as switches and passive devices is about one-fourth of high voltage side (HVS) voltage. Also, since power flow is controlled only by the phase shift angle, the operation of the forward and backward modes becomes symmetrical, thereby making power flow change seamless without any complex control. The duty cycle is used to equalize voltages of capacitors of high voltage side (HVS), thereby making the voltage ratings of components exactly same and ensuring soft-switching of switches under wide voltage and load range. A 2 kW prototype is implemented and tested to verify validity of the proposed converter. © 2017 IEEE.","High stepup/ down ratio; Non-isolated bidirectional converter; PPS control","Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric rectifiers; Energy conversion; HVDC power transmission; Power converters; Zero voltage switching; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Bidirectional power flow; Continuous current modes; Forward-and-backward; Half-bridge converters; High step-ups; Isolated bidirectional converters; Voltage ratings; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041434688

People with low vision used to use their remaining vision to solve the problems they encounter in everyday life. However, existing auxiliary devices are mostly suitable for reading text or viewing display screens indoors, but auxiliary devices for outdoor situations are rare. Methods In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews of people with low vision who encounter vulnerable situations or obstacles while walking. Stairs, building entrances, bollards, sidewalk obstacles, and crosswalks were found to be the most difficult situations that people suffering from low vision experienced during outdoor walking. We proposed four visual aids through head-mounted display(HMD) that are expected to assist people with low vision on their outdoor walks by enabling them to recognize their surroundings more clearly. The four aids were contrast filter, contour filter, simple augmented reality(AR), and delicate AR. Then, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of each aid, we conducted an experiment with visual images reflecting each aid. Results The perception of the peripheral environment of people with low vision was most accurate when they utilized the AR aids. Especially, with the AR aids, highlighting the obstacles' shapes without abstraction showed the highest task success rate and satisfaction over all situations. On the other hand, the visual filters that can enhance the contrast and contour of the obstacles resulted in lower perception accuracy than when filters were not used. Conclusions In order to support the outdoor walking of people with low vision through the use of HMD or smart phones, it is most desirable to employ an augmented reality that can emphasize the shapes of major obstacles, the directions of roads, and the signals of traffic lights.","Augmented reality; Outdoor walking aid; People with low vision; Visual filter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038399412

Don is a traditional herb that has been associated with multiple biological activities. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative/antiaging activities and performed an active component analysis of the non-fermented and fermented (using Lactobacillus pentosus) extracts of Lespedeza cuneata G. Don. The antioxidative activities of the fermented extract were higher than those of non-fermented extracts. The elastase inhibitory activity, inhibitory effects on UV-induced MMP-1 expression, and ability to promote type I procollagen synthesis were investigated in Hs68 human fibroblasts cells. These tests also revealed that the fermented extract had increased antiaging activities compared with the non-fermented extract. A component analysis of the ethyl acetate fractions of non-fermented and fermented extracts was performed using TLC, HPLC, and LC/ESI-MS/MS to observe changes in the components before and after fermentation. Six components that were different before and after fermentation were investigated. It was thought that kaempferol and quercetin were converted from kaempferol glucosides and quercetin glucosides, respectively, via bioconversion with the fermentation strain.

As a direct fabrication method, a promising application of AM is to make personalized or customized parts; biomedical applications customized to human’s bodies can provide improved functionalities for an example. In this study, a customized plastic cast is developed to replace traditional plaster casts. For customization, its basic shape is defined out of three-dimensional (3d) scan data of a human arm. This cast is designed to have a number of holes for lighter weight and better ventilation, and to be printed using a Material extrusion (ME) type 3d printer that uses thermoplastic polymer filaments. Finite element (FE) analyses are then performed to evaluate the structural safety and stiffness of the printed cast with porosity. Considering that the structural safety and stiffness are degenerated due to the porous structure, design reinforcements are suggested to improve the bending stiffness of the porous cast. FE analyses are then performed with variations of design parameters of the reinforcement structures, from which we obtain the best design candidate that provides higher specific stiffness than the conventional solid structure. A porous-customized cast with lighter weight and better ventilation can thereby be developed successfully. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","3d printing; Additive manufacturing; Customized cast; Finite element analysis; Lightweight structure","Design for manufacturability; Finite element method; Manufacture; Medical applications; Porosity; Reinforcement; Safety engineering; Stiffness; 3-D printing; Bending stiffness; Biomedical applications; Direct fabrications; Reinforcement structures; Specific stiffness; Thermoplastic polymer; Three-dimensional (3D) scans; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034968375

In this type of environment, they become subject to higher water pressure. The concrete material of the structures is exposed to wet conditions for longer periods of time, which makes the proper adhesion of waterproofing membranes difficult. Joint movements from increased structural settlement, thermal expansion/shrinkage, and physical loads from external sources (e.g., vehicles) make securing durable waterproofing challenging. While ASTM Guides, Korean Codes, and BS Practice Codes on below-grade waterproofing stress the importance of manufacturer specification for quality control, ensuring high quality waterproofing for the ever-changing scale of construction remains a challenge. This study proposes a new evaluation method and criteria which allow for the selection of waterproofing membranes based on specific performance attributes and workmanship. It subjects six different waterproofing membrane systems (installed on dry and wet surface conditioned mortar slab specimens with an artificial joint to different cyclic movement widths) to 300 cycles in water to demonstrate that inadequate material properties and workmanship are key causes for leakages. © 2017 by the authors.","Concrete structure; Dry and wet surface adhesion; Joint displacement; Movement cycle; Overlap joint; Performance evaluation; Waterproofing membrane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033585483

The performance of the MPTCP can be degraded due to the head-of-line (HOL) blocking caused by path heterogeneity, when a buffer size is limited. This performance degradation can be overcome by a careful design of a scheduler, which has a role of allocating each data segment to one of subflows. We derive the theoretical limit of the achievable aggregate throughput and show that the optimality is achieved when the load is balanced between subflows. Based on the analysis, we propose the optimal load balancing (OLB) scheduler that approximately achieves the theoretical throughput limit. By simulations and experiments, we show that the proposed OLB scheduler outperforms the default scheduler of the Linux MPTCP implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bandwidth aggregation; Heterogeneous wireless environment; Load balancing; LTE-WiFi integration; MPTCP; Scheduler","Bandwidth; Computer operating systems; Resource allocation; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bandwidth aggregations; Head of line blocking; MPTCP; Multi-path transmission control protocols; Optimal load balancing; Performance degradation; Scheduler; Wireless environment; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031097768

Therefore, it is required to explore the possible distributional changes of rainfall characteristics over time. The objective of present study is to assess the distributional changes in annual and northeast monsoon rainfall (November-January) and river flow in Sarawak where small changes in rainfall or river flow variability/distribution may have severe implications on ecology and agriculture. A quantile regression-based approach was used to assess the changes of scale and location of empirical probability density function over the period 1980-2014 at 31 observational stations. The results indicate that diverse variation patterns exist at all stations for annual rainfall but mainly increasing quantile trend at the lowers, and higher quantiles for the month of January and December. The significant increase in annual rainfall is found mostly in the north and central-coastal region and monsoon month rainfalls in the interior and north of Sarawak.

Even though the weight average molecular weight Mw reached values around 40,000 g/mole, no membranes could be prepared from this ionene, probably because of its rigid backbone. Blending with 33, 41 and 50 wt% PBI-OO gave access to self-supporting membranes. In comparison with pure PBI-OO, these membranes have a higher water uptake (30–50%) and show a chloride conductivity around 0.5 mS/cm at 60 °C. In the VRFB, the membranes absorb sulfuric acid, which increases the conductivity. Nevertheless, the voltage efficiency (VE) of PBI-OO was surprisingly low. Further analysis suggests that the polymer gets easily sulfonated, leading to ionic crosslinking and thus reduced conductivity. At OCV, the PBI-OO based membrane showed a very low potential degradation rate of 0.19 mV/h even over 280 h, while the OCV decreased 60% within 60 h for Nafion 212. Charge/discharge curves revealed that the coulomb efficiency (CE) decreases with increasing amount of the ionene, while the VE increases. This indicates a potential for improved membranes by blending PBI or its derivatives (responsible for high CE) with highly conducting ion exchange materials to increase the VE in comparison to the pure polymer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2-Mesityl-benzimidazole; anion exchange membrane (AEM); Ionenes; PBI-OO; Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB)","Blending; Crosslinking; Degradation; Efficiency; Electric batteries; Flow batteries; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; 2-Mesityl-benzimidazole; Anion exchange membranes (AEM); Ionenes; PBI-OO; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030091206

It is therefore important to develop glucose biosensor that reads the concentration of glucose in blood precisely. In the present work, we suggest new glucose oxidase (GOx) based catalysts that can improve the sensitivity of the glucose biosensor and make glucose measurements over a wide concentration ranges possible. For synthesizing such catalysts, a composite including pyrenecarboxaldehyde (PCA) and GOx is attached to substrate including carbon nanotube (CNT) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) (CNT/PEI/[PCA/GOx]). Catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst are then evaluated. According to the investigation, the catalyst shows excellent glucose sensitivity of 47.83 μAcm−2mM−1, low Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.2 mM, and wide glucose concentration detection, while it has good glucose selectivity against inhibitors, such as uric acid and ascorbic acid. Also, its activity is maintained to 95.7% of its initial value even after four weeks, confirming the catalyst is stable enough. The excellence of the catalyst is attributed to hydrophobic interaction, C=N bonds, and π-hydrogen interaction among GOx, PCA and PEI/CNT. The bindings play a role in facilitating electron transport between GOx and electrode. © 2017, Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.","Diabetes; Glucose Biosensor; Glucose Oxidase; Hypoglycemia; Pyrenecarboxaldehyde",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028977551

A test FPSE is designed from root locus analyses and developed with flexure springs and a dashpot load. The stiffness of the test springs and the damping characteristics of the dashpot are identified through experiments. An experimental test rig is developed with an electric heater and a water cooler, operating under the atmospheric air. The piston dynamic behaviors, including the operating frequency, piston stroke, and phase angle, and engine output performance are measured at various heater temperatures and external loads. The experimental results are compared to dynamic model predictions. The test FPSE is also compared to a conventional kinematic engine in terms of engine output performance and dynamic adaptation to environments.

Since the specimens and grips with thread may disturb the wave propagation between bars and specimen, the stress-strain relation of the specimen, which is calculated from the strains of the incident and transmitter bars, may not match with the stress-strain relation measured directly from the specimen. In order to ensure a high accuracy of SHTB system, specimen calibration is usually carried out. To ensure the no wave distortion in the thread region, the stress wave should be entirely transmitted from the incident bar to the transmitter bar in tests using the calibration specimen (not the real specimen) of the same material and the same diameter with the transmitter and incident bars. Therefore, the strain signals at the incident and transmitter bars need to be the same. This study investigated the wave transmit characteristics through threads in SHTB test. To investigate the effect of the thread on the wave transmission, a specimen with the same diameter of the incident and the transmitter bars is used in the SHTB test. The effects of the thread inner diameter, yield stress, thread type, and strike velocity on the wave propagation characteristics are investigated. Based on the analysis results for various conditions, a proper design guide for a thread shape to secure the measurement accuracy in the SHTB test is proposed. © 2017","Calibration specimen; Finite element method; High strain rate; Split Hopkinson tensile bar; Thread design","Calibration; Elastic waves; Finite element method; Strain; Stress-strain curves; Transmitters; Wave propagation; Wave transmission; Yield stress; Calibration specimens; High strain rates; Numerical investigations; Split Hopkinson tensile bars; Stress strain relation; Thread design; Transmitting characteristics; Wave propagation characteristics; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022330384

[CNT/Lac/PEI/Lac]/GA shows that the best electron transfer rate constants (ks) achieved, in the presence as well as the absence of a mediator, are 8.6 and 1.8 s−1. Additionally, [CNT/Lac/PEI/Lac]/GA results in high performance of Maximum Power Density with a value of 0.2 mW cm−2. Its relative stability can be maintained up to 83.76% with relative efficiency up to 84.73%, while CNT/Lac gives the lowest performance levels. This indicates that GA induces an improvement in catalytic activity by (i) increasing the amount of immobilized laccase and (ii) strengthening interaction between laccase and PEI. Therefore, it induces excellent redox reactivity, promoting the ORR, and glucose/O2 biofuel cell performance. The effect of pH on catalytic activity is also measured, with pH 5 being optimal. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Glucose/O2 biofuel cells; Glutaraldehyde; Laccase; Oxygen reduction reaction; Poly(ethylenimine)","Biofuels; Biological fuel cells; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Catalysts; Cells; Crosslinking; Cytology; Electrolytic reduction; Electron transitions; Enzymatic fuel cells; Enzymes; Nanotubes; Rate constants; Yarn; Glucose/O; Glutaraldehydes; Laccases; Oxygen reduction reaction; Poly(ethylenimine); Catalyst activity; biofuel; glucose oxidase; laccase; multi walled nanotube; carbon nanotube; cross linking reagent; glucose; immobilized enzyme; laccase; oxygen; Article; biocatalyst; biocathode; chemical structure; cross linking; electrode; electron transport; energy resource; enzymatic biofuel cell; enzyme activity; oxidation reduction reaction; physical chemistry; biocatalysis; bioenergy; chemistry; genetic procedures; kinetics; metabolism; nanotechnology; pH; scanning electron microscopy; ultrastructure; Biocatalysis; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biosensing Techniques; Cross-Linking Reagents; Electron Transport; Enzymes, Immobilized; Glucose; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Laccase; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Molecular Structure; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes, Carbon; Oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021716753

The model employs the least squares method to predict the number of potholes in the Seoul metropolitan area. Independent variables were determined, based on traffic and weather data for each month in Seoul. Prior to the development of predictive models, empirical and stochastic factors that affect the occurrence of potholes were determined, resulting in a standardized regression coefficient from multi-linear regression analysis. A best-fit equation was derived from experiments using independent variables obtained from empirical and analytical approaches. The empirically and analytically filtered factors for each road management area in Seoul were used to develop the predictive models for the multiple regression analysis and the HSA. Fourteen predictive models were determined in this study.

The deficiency also inhibits government agencies to allocate discrete and reasonable budgets when requesting BIM related services. This research focuses on the Architecture and Engineering (AE) industry and provides a framework to estimate costs for BIM design services based on the cost-plus pricing approach. The framework utilizes cost data from 54 projects to estimate average man-hours, and ‘man-hour coefficients’ for standard and non-standard work items. The man-hours can further be broken down to different design phases, disciplines and at different levels of development. The framework was implemented in an Excel-based system, which allows users to produce estimates for 11 different building project types, while providing flexibility in selecting preferred BIM services. Validation showed that the system produces accurate estimates for specific projects with customized requirements. By providing an objective approach for estimating the costs of BIM services, it allows clients and AE firms to agree upon a fair cost, and thus expedite its adoption in Korea. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","BIM; cost estimating; cost-plus; design services","Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Costs; Architecture and engineering; Building Information Model - BIM; Building projects; Design services; Engineering service; Excel-based system; Government agencies; Objective approaches; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015237665

Their performances are compared with those of Nafion membranes. Immersed in 2 M H2SO4, PBI absorbs about 2 mol of H2SO4 per mole of repeat unit. This results in low conductivity and low voltage efficiency (VE). In ex-situ tests, meta-PBI shows a negligible crossover of V3+ and V4+ ions, much lower than that of Nafion. This is due to electrostatic repulsive forces between vanadium cations and positively charged protonated PBI backbones, and the molecular sieving effect of PBI's nanosized pores. It turns out that charge efficiency (CE) of VRFBs using meta-PBI-based membranes is unaffected by or slightly increases with decreasing membrane thickness. Thick meta-PBI membranes require about 100 mV larger potentials to achieve the same charging current as thin meta-PBI membranes. This additional potential may increase side reactions or enable more vanadium ions to overcome the electrostatic energy barrier and to enter the membrane. On this basis, H2SO4-doped meta-PBI membranes should be thin to achieve high VE and CE. The energy efficiency of 15 μm thick PBI reaches 92%, exceeding that of Nafion 212 and 117 (N212 and N117) at 40 mA cm-2. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","coulombic efficiency; electrostatic energy barrier; meta-polybenzimidazole-based membranes; vanadium crossover; vanadium redox flow batteries","Electric batteries; Electrostatics; Energy barriers; Energy efficiency; Membranes; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Coulombic efficiency; Electrostatic energies; Electrostatic repulsive forces; Membrane thickness; Molecular-sieving effects; Polybenzimidazole; Positively charged; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032992965

Inclusion of different types of variables may lead to complications in regression analysis. Many regression algorithms such as linear regression, support vector regression, and neural networks that train parameters of a model to identify relations between input and output variables, can easily process numeric variables; however, there are additional considerations for categorical variables. On the other hand, a decision tree algorithm estimates a target based on the specified rules; therefore, it can support categorical variables as well as numeric variables. Using this property, a new hybrid model combining a decision tree with another regression algorithm is proposed to analyze mixed data. In the proposed model, the portions explained by categorical variables in target values are estimated by the decision tree and the remaining parts are predicted by any regression algorithm trained by numerical variables. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using 12 datasets selected from real decision problems, and it was confirmed that the proposed algorithm achieved better or comparable accuracy than the comparison methods including the M5 decision tree and the evolutionary tree. In addition, the new hybrid method does not significantly increase computational complexity, even though it builds two separate models, which is an advantage that is in contrast with the M5 decision tree and the evolutionary tree. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decision tree; Hybrid model; Mixed data; Regression","Clustering algorithms; Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Regression analysis; Trees (mathematics); Categorical variables; Decision-tree algorithm; Hybrid decision trees; Hybrid model; Mixed data; Regression; Regression algorithms; Support vector regression (SVR); Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027877017

The amorphous precursor experiences some microstructural transformations during the hydrothermal treatment, and after 16 h a Samarium-Cerium hydroxide carbonate, characterized by a hexagonal crystalline lattice, spherical morphology and particles of about 100 nm in size, with a very low degree of agglomeration, is the only present phase in contrast to the initial amorphous state. After the calcination step, the powders which preserved this morphology are still characterized by the absence of hard agglomerates. As a consequence, these powders exhibited an excellent sintering behaviour with a microstructure characterized by regular, equiaxed and micrometric grain size.

Commonly, a pure integrator based on the voltage model is used to estimate stator flux linkages for its simplicity. However, due to noise errors such as strong Gaussian noise variance, a drift and a dc offset are easily produced by the integrator when the back electromotive force (emf) is relatively smaller than Gaussian noise variance. Thus, the pure integrator is replaced by the programmable LPF to reduce those errors. The performance of the induction motor control mainly depends on the accuracy of the estimated flux. When the back emf is very small and noisy, an enhanced method of the programmable LPF is applied to improve the flux estimation. Such method is verified and implemented by a simulation tool called Simulink. © 2016 IEEE.","Back emf; DC offset; drift; flux estimation; noise; programmable LPF","Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Induction motors; Industrial electronics; Low pass filters; Spurious signal noise; Stators; Back-emf; DC offsets; drift; Flux estimation; noise; programmable LPF; Sensorless control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034100900

A challenge in implementing 2-D metal chalcogenides in emerging devices is to prepare a well-crystallized layer over large areas at temperatures compatible with current fabrication processes. Tin monosulfide, a p-type layered semiconductor with a high hole mobility, is a promising candidate for realizing large-area growth at low temperatures because of its low melting point. However, tin sulfides exist in two notable crystalline phases, SnS and SnS2. Therefore, it is imperative to control the oxidation state of Sn to achieve a pure SnS film. Here, the synthesis of SnS thin films by atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) is demonstrated using bis(1-dimethylamino-2-methyl-2-propoxy)tin(II) and H2S as Sn and S sources, respectively, over a wide temperature window (90-240 °C). Impurities such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen were negligibly detected. The morphological evolution of plate-like orthorhombic SnS grains was observed above 210 °C. Moreover, properties of thin film transistors and gas sensors using SnS films as the active layers were investigated. The SnS ALD process would provide promising opportunities to exploit the intriguing properties of the 2-D metal chalcogenides for realizing emerging electronic devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Chalcogenides; Deposition; Hole mobility; Inorganic compounds; Ionic liquids; Layered semiconductors; Semiconductor growth; Sulfur compounds; Thin film transistors; Thin films; Tin; Crystalline phasis; Current fabrication; Electronic device; Low melting point; Metal chalcogenide; Morphological evolution; Temperature window; Two Dimensional (2 D); Atomic layer deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032220250

In this study, tyrosol-incorporated copolyoxalate (TPOX) was synthesized by using 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenol (tyrosol), and oxalyl chloride (Mw ∼ 8835 Da). In vitro drug release behavior was assessed by loading nile red, a lipophilic fluorescent material such as quercetin, into the TPOX nanoparticles. The results indicated that the release of TPOX nanopaticles depended on the H2O2 concentration, but was pH-independent. We confirmed that TPOX nanoparticles under oxidative conditions in oxidative- or inflammatory-damaged cells selectively released entrapped nile red through the degradation by H2O2 for contributing to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. For application, we prepared and evaluated the cytoprotective effect of quercetin-loaded TPOX (QTPOX) nanoparticles against oxidative and inflammatory stress. They showed a strong cytoprotective effect against H2O2-induced cell damage in HaCaT and RAW 264.7 cells. Also, QTPOX nanoparticles inhibited the main factors of LPS-induced inflammation, including iNOS, COX-2, IL-1, TNF-α, and NO production. These results suggest that QTPOX as H2O2-responsive therapeutic nanoparticles is highly potent and versatile as drug delivery system through selective and intensive drug release mechanism for the treatment of abnormal and inflammatory skin diseases. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Antioxidants; Cells; Chemical compounds; Cytology; Flavonoids; Pathology; Phenols; 1 ,4-cyclohexanedimethanol; Anti-inflammatory activity; Anti-inflammatory effects; Cytoprotective effects; Drug release mechanism; Fluorescent materials; Oxidative conditions; Reactive oxygen species; Nanoparticles; 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; cyclooxygenase 2; hydrogen peroxide; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1; nanoparticle; nitric oxide; polymer; quercetin; reactive oxygen metabolite; tumor necrosis factor; tyrosol; tyrosol incorporated copolyoxalate nanoparticle; unclassified drug; 4-hydroxyphenylethanol; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; cyclooxygenase 2; hydrogen peroxide; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1; nanoparticle; nitric oxide; oxalic acid derivative; phenethyl alcohol; quercetin; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; cell damage; cell protection; cell viability; controlled study; drug degradation; drug release; drug synthesis; drug uptake; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; nanomedicine; oxidative stress; particle size; pH; phagocytosis; priority journal; RAW 264.7 cell line; skin cell; analogs and derivatives; animal; cell line; chemistry; drug effect; keratinocyte; macrophage; metabolism; mouse; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Cell Line; Cyclooxygenase 2; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Interleukin-1; Keratinocytes; Macrophages; Mice; Nanoparticles; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II; Oxalates; Phenylethyl Alcohol; Quercetin; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031284166

Structural investigations indicate that the ZnO NRs grew well along the porous CP surface. Optical investigation shows that the crystal quality of the ZnO NRs on the CP was comparable to that of NRs grown on Si substrate. As the molar concentration increased from 10-70 mM, the output voltage and current increased consistently from 3.6-6.8 V and 0.79-1.45 μA, respectively. The enhancements of the voltage and current were attributed to the enhanced accumulation of the potentials generated by the increased number of ZnO NRs in the PENG devices. Therefore, the porous CP enhanced the PENG performance due to the higher surface area, and provided a super-flexible self-powering platform. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","flexible; piezoelectric nanogenerators; ZnO nanorods","Nanorods; Nanotechnology; Paper; Piezoelectricity; Zinc oxide; Crystal qualities; flexible; Molar concentration; Nanogenerators; Optical investigation; Output voltages; Structural investigation; ZnO nanorod; Zinc compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032176061

In spite of this increase, further research is needed to address the paucity of literature on cross-cultural marriage, particularly, between immigrants and their indigenous spouses. In this study, we have focused on the cross-cultural marriages between female Korean immigrants who have married Americans, aiming to identify the positive and/or negative aspects of cross-cultural marriage from the Korean women themselves. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted on a total of 14 participants. Their ages ranged from 45 to 66 years (M D 52.5 years) and the average length of time since their immigration was 25 years. Each interview lasted between 45 and 120 min and, with participants' permission, were recorded and transcribed. Based on the participants' life experiences and personal statements, we divided our findings into two sections: (a) issues and problems of cross-cultural marriages, and (b) strengths of cross-cultural marriages. With regard to the issues and problems of cross-cultural marriages experienced by participants, three major themes were identified: (a) communication barriers, (b) cultural conflicts and misunderstandings, and (c) unclear cultural identities. The strengths of cross-cultural marriages were identified as: (a) development of coping strategies, and (b) improving cultural understanding.

From S-N curves for 50%~0.01% failure probability, the fatigue life of the long-term use rail for each track type was derived using the weight probability analysis technique on the experimental data. Because the rails used in the fatigue test have different cumulative tonnages, the number of repetitions was modified by averaging the cumulative tonnage. In addition, the bending stresses of rail bottoms, considering rail surface irregularities, track support stiffnesses and train speeds, were evaluated using the predicted rail bending stresses derived from existing studies. As a result, for rail fatigue life evaluation, the fatigue life of rail on the ballast track was found to be more than 200 million tons higher than the standard value for rail replacement. Also, the fatigue life of rail on concrete track is more than 300 million tons higher than that on ballast track.

Overbreak during tunnel construction may be unavoidable, and is very influential on overall stability. Over-excavation in tunneling is also one of the most important factors in construction costs. Overbreak problems around crown areas have decreased with improvements of excavation methods, but overbreak problems around bottom areas have not decreased because those areas are not very influential on tunnel stability compared with crown areas. The filling costs of 10 cm thickness of overbreak at the bottom of a tunnel are covered under construction costs by Korea Railway Authority regulations, but filling costs for more than the covered thickness are considered losses of construction cost. The filling material for overbreak bottoms of tunnels should be concrete, but concrete and mixed granular materials with fractured rock are also used for some sites. Tunnels in which granular materials with fractured rock are used may have a discontinuous section under the concrete slab track. The discontinuous section influences the propagation of waves generated from train operation. When the bottom of a tunnel is filled with only concrete material, the bottom of the tunnel can be considered as a continuous section, in which the waves generated from a train may propagate without reflection waves. However, a discontinuous section filled with mixed granular materials may reflect waves, which can cause resonance of vibration. The filled materials and vibration propagation characteristics are studied in this research. Tunnel bottom filling materials that have ratios of granular material to concrete of 5.0 %, 11.5 %, and 18.0 % are investigated. Samples were made and tested to determine their material properties. Static numerical analyses were performed using the FEM program under train operation load; test results were found to satisfy the stability requirements. However, dynamic analysis results show that some mixed ratios may generate resonance vibration from train operation at certain speeds. © 2017 The Korean Society for Railway.

The results showed that the hydrogen embrittiement susceptibility of the high-manganese steels increased with increasing inherent strength because deformation mechanisms, such as deformation twinning, e-martensite transformation, and shear- or micro-band formation, enhanced their sensitivity to hydrogen-induced cracking. The different hydrogen charging methods also affected their ability to achieve the critical hydrogen concentration needed for hydrogen-induced cracking under the stress fields of each microstructure. The relative reduction in ductility for different charging methods usually increased in the order of ex-situ electrochemically-charged, ex-situ high-pressure thermally-charged, and in-situ environment tensile testing, although it was somewhat dependent on the charging, testing and specimen conditions. Based on the results of the three high-manganese steels, it was found that the high-pressure thermally-charged steel specimens had higher relative reductions in ductility because a larger amount of hydrogen was uniformly injected into the steel specimens, which promoted hydrogen-induced cracking under smaller strain than that of the electrochemically-charged steel specimens.

A total of 263 sport-poomsae competitors (112 females; 151 males; aged between 12-44 years), who competed at the 2014 sport poomsae taekwondo competition, participated in this study. The prevalence rate of COP and possible risk factors associated with COP were analyzed by using Chi-square tests and independent t-tests.RESULTS: A total of 173 athletes reported that they experienced COP (65.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.5-71.5). Female athletes showed a higher prevalence rate than their male counterparts (75.9% vs. 58.3%). Lower body (61.5%) and knee joints (26.4%) were the two primarily injured body part. A total of 101 athletes reported that they injured in the previous year. Among those, 81.2% were suffered from COP. The technique that caused pain most frequently was side-kick among females and front-kick among males. Prevalence rates of COP were significantly different by sex, education level, training hour, and a history of injury.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COP is high among sport poomsae taekwondo athletes. Competitors who are female, have a history of injury, and train for extended hours were more likely to experience COP. To identify other potential risk factors of COP in sport poomsae taekwondo, more research is needed to build upon the findings. © 2017 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","Cumulative trauma disorders; Martial arts; Prevalence","adolescent; adult; chi square distribution; chronic pain; cross-sectional study; cumulative trauma disorder; female; human; injuries; lower limb; male; martial art; prevalence; risk factor; sex ratio; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Chi-Square Distribution; Chronic Pain; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cumulative Trauma Disorders; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Martial Arts; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028695565

Cinnamon extracts were prepared using hot water extract and 70% ethanol extract. Prior to inducing inflammation, co-cultured Caco-2 cells with RAW264.7 cells were treated with the cinnamon extracts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was treated to induce inflammation in RAW264.7 cells. Compared to LPS-treated groups, the cells treated with cinnamon extracts maintained high transepithelial electrical resistance and decreased tight junction permeability, similar to that shown by control Caco-2 cells. In addition, cinnamon extract-treated cells showed decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely nitrite (NO), PGE2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-α.

The characteristics of the particles were determined via X-ray diffraction, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, TEM, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The absorption band at 1031 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of structural Si–O band groups of smectite and MNS. The onset of transmittance of the nano-maghemite against ultraviolet decreased at a wavelength of 400 nm. Pretreatment with MNS was not cytotoxic against Hs 68 cells. The secretion of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α of the nanoparticles decreased by 41.83% and 29.56% at 100 μg/mL MNS in human skin fibroblast Hs 68 cells compared to in ultraviolet-irradiated controls.

Many studies have been conducted on how to manage multiple power sources of a vehicle based on various optimization theories. In this study, an algorithm to calculate the optimization of a series HEV that has three power generating components, engine, battery and ultra-capacitor, is developed based on dynamic programming. Normally dynamic programming is applied to the optimization of power management and components sizing by estimating potential fuel economy for electrified vehicle such as HEV, Plug-in HEV or Fuelcell HEV. In contrast with most objective systems that have only two power generating components, the system in this study has three power sources. Since the system has three power sources, the number of state and control variables of optimization problem increases. Therefore the number of calculations increases unreasonably. To decrease the number and time of calculations, a new electric model that contains the both characteristics of battery and ultra-capacitor is developed with some assumptions. In comparison with the optimization algorithm which follows the theory of DP with no assumptions, the results from the newly developed algorithm has 1.04 % discrepancy in terms of fuel economy, even though the calculation time decreases to 4400 times less. © 2017, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Backward simulation; Dynamic programming; Fuel economy; Power management optimization; Series hybrid electric vehicle","Electric batteries; Electric power measurement; Energy management; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Hybrid vehicles; Optimization; Power management; Secondary batteries; Site selection; Vehicles; Backward simulations; Dynamic programming application; Electrified vehicles; Hybrid electric vehicle systems; Multiple power sources; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Series hybrid electric vehicles; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021934224

The proposed topology consists of a three-phase push-pull based ac to dc rectifier with a MF ac link employing two active switches. A three-phase, five-limb, multiwinding MF transformer is employed for isolation. The secondary side of the transformer is connected in a zig-zag configuration and is fed to two six-pulse diode rectifiers, achieving 12-pulse rectifier operation. The primary advantage of the proposed system is reduction in size/weight/volume compared to the conventional 60 Hz magnetic transformer isolation rectifier system. Operating the transformer at 600 Hz is shown to result in three times reduction in size. Furthermore, the proposed system employs only two active semiconductor switching devices operating under a simple pulse width modulation scheme.

The proposed method makes possible for mapping texture of a realistic ortho-photo data to virtual terrain data which are unable to take satellite photo or aerial photo.

Economic, social, and environmental flood hazards are taken into account. The importance of each hazard is quantified through a survey to the experts. Utilizing the proposed framework, sustainability-based flood hazard mapping is performed for the 100-year design event. As a result, the overall flood hazard is provided in each geographic location. The sensitivity of the overall hazard with respect to the weights of the three hazard components were also investigated. While the conventional flood management approach is to assess the environmental impacts of mitigation measures after a set of feasible options are selected, the presented framework incorporates the environmental impacts into the analysis concurrently with the economic and social influences.

However, with the increase in the use of open source software, we can be exposed to the various problems based on the weakness of open source. The weakness of heartbleed ‘OpenSSL’ has actually brought about much damage world-wide. In addition, as the open source software makes a lot of increases in quantity and has the property of the unprofessional and similar development, it is not proper to apply the existing secure code checking system. It means that the checking system faster than the existing secure coding checking system is required to meet the demand of the fast growing open source software market. This requires the code based analysis which is proper for not the simple static analysis but for the cloud computing. In addition, to make up for the unprofessional and similar development, the secure code checking system based on the smart fuzzing like neuro fuzzy is required. Thus, in this paper, we have suggested a smart fuzzing system made in connection to the black box and white box test which can effectively detect/distinguish the weakness of software and also suggested a way to verify whether it is exploitable and a way to automatically produce exploit through this. Also mis-detection and un-detection was minimized and a weakness analysis method based on symbols was applied to accurately detect security weakness. The suggested system can secure reliability of the open source software by deducting the reason for security weakness of open source software which is used in various industries and can prevent weaknesses earlier on in open source software made afterwards.

Recently, several studies have focused on establishing strategies to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide in the AEC industry by utilisation of low-carbon materials, material reuse, recycling and minimal usage; selection of an optimal structural system and structural optimisation; and optimisation of construction operations. While several studies examined material selection and replacement in concrete, there is a paucity of studies investigating the replacement and implementation of high-strength re-bars to lower the carbon dioxide emissions in buildings. To fill this research gap, the purpose of this study involves calculating the emissions of carbon dioxide by applying high-strength reinforcement bars in three different types of buildings. The input-output analysis method was adopted to compute the emissions of carbon dioxide by using the yield strength and size. This study showed that the application of the high-strength re-bars is beneficial in reducing the input amount of materials, although the quantity of reinforcing bars on the development and splice increased.

The developed robotic transfemoral prosthesis in this study has a knee joint and ankle roll/pitch joints for walking on complex slopes. The walking motion data obtained from the motion capture system are used as the standard walking pattern data to accurately imitate the inherent gait of the wearer. Walking intention, percent of gait cycle (PGC), and walking stride are predicted through two inertial sensors attached at both thighs, and the joint angles of the robotic transfemoral prosthesis are then generated in real-time from the PGC and the standard walking pattern data. Additionally, variable impedance control and zero moment point (ZMP) control are carried out with a force/torque sensor for posture stabilization against variable ground slopes, and ground slope compensation and disturbance rejection are also done with the use of inertial sensors at the foot and shank. Consequently, the performance of the walking pattern generation algorithm and posture stabilization control was verified through walking experiments of an author on an inclined treadmill. © 2017 Taylor & Francis and The Robotics Society of Japan.","motion capture; posture stabilization; Powered prosthetic leg; walking pattern generation","Disturbance rejection; Inertial navigation systems; Joint prostheses; Joints (anatomy); Prosthetics; Robotics; Stabilization; Force/torque sensor; Motion capture; Motion capture system; Posture stabilization; Prosthetic leg; Trans-femoral prosthesis; Variable impedance control; Walking pattern generation; Pattern recognition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031499702

It has long been used as traditional folk remedies for alcohol intoxication. Aim of the study To examine the anti-hangover effect of Hovenia dulcis Thunb. fruit extract (HDE) in a randomized controlled crossover trial. Materials and methods Twenty-six eligible male adults with heterozygous ALDH2 (23.7±0.3 years old) consumed 360 mL of Korean Soju (50 g alcohol) together with HDE (2460 mg) or matched placebo with subsequent crossover. The blood samples were taken at baseline and 1, 4, and 12 h post-treatment. Results Blood alcohol, acetaldehyde, and total hangover scores were highest at 1 h post-treatment with no difference between groups, but declines in hangover symptom scores were significant in the HDE group compared to the placebo group. Significant differences between groups were also observed on interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-10/IL-6 ratio, and aspartate aminotransferase levels, but not on endotoxins. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between total hangover symptom scores and IL-6 and IL-10 level. Further analyses by CYP2E1 polymorphism at rs10776687, rs2031920, rs3813867, and rs4838767 alleles showed a reversed association, suggesting that CYP2E1 polymorphism might be an effect modifier. Conclusions The results suggest that a favorable effect of HDE on alcohol hangovers might be associated with enhancing homeostatic regulation of inflammatory response.

Generally, the TE of the MR-WPT system is decreased by a 3D spatial variation (distance and location) in between the transmitter (Tx) source and the receiver (Rx) load. To improve and optimise the TE for this spatial variation, the authors utilised RF switches in a planar arrayed coils in the Rx.

The subjects of the analysis are about 21,000 research papers collected from the database of 'Web of Science' which is an academic information database. Using the open source software, Khcoder, semantic network analysis was carried out with meta information such as theses, abstracts, research fields. As a result of the analysis, major research areas were divided into traffic model and analysis, energy efficiency, vehicle, and mobile behavior. As a result of analyzing the major research changes by period, researches focused on reducing the use of fossil fuels before and after the 1992 Climate Change Convention have increased intensively. This can explain that the policy has a great influence on the flow of research. From 1970 to 1996, there were 9772 research articles in the United States and 456 research articles in Korea. Results of the semantic network analysis The United States and Korea show similar network patterns despite differences in terms such as history, geography, economic power, and population. However, the difference between Korea and the United States is that research on public transport such as buses and transportation is being carried out steadily. This explains that Korean transportation research and policy accepts American academic theory as it is, but it shows that public transportation research should be continuously carried out in accordance with the situation of Korea where population is small and population is concentrated in city. Quantitative and objective analysis methods need to be developed to objectively analyze advanced European transport policies and research trends promoting public transport policies for the above reasons. Therefore, this study is meaningful because it tried to analyze research trend through quantitative analysis method called semantic network analysis. © 2017 IEEE.","khcoder; policy; semantic network analysis; transportation","Climate change; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Mass transportation; Open source software; Open systems; Public policy; Semantics; Software engineering; Transportation; European transport policy; Information database; khcoder; Objective analysis; Public transportation; Semantic analysis; Semantic network analysis; Transportation research; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032377397

Waste concrete is generally recycled as recycled aggregates, and many studies have been conducted to seek ways to improve their quality. Such quality improvement processes has led to the generation of byproducts such as waste concrete powder, which needs to be recycled efficiently based on further research. Accordingly, this study was conducted with the aim to use waste concrete powder (WCP) to substitute silica powder in the manufacturing of the extrusion concrete panels in cases where high SiO2 content is not a requirement. The results of this study showed a negative correlation between flexural strength and silica powder-WCP substitution ratio. For example, 50% substitution resulted in a product that satisfied the required flexural strength over 14 MPa as stipulated by the Korean Industrials Standards, and it gave rise to properties such as specific gravity, absorption ratio, length change, thermal conductivity, and fire-resistance that were similar to those of plain specimens. Based on these results, it was deemed that it would be possible to use WCP as an alternative material in place of siliceous fillers in cases where high-purity is not required. © 2017 by the authors.","Concrete panel; Extrusion panel; Recycling; Silica powder; Waste concrete; Waste concrete powder",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029223313

This NiII porphyrin complex 1 quantitatively catalyzed the epoxidation reaction of a wide range of olefins with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) under mild conditions. Reactivity and Hammett studies, H2 18O-exchange experiments, and the use of PPAA (peroxyphenylacetic acid) as a mechanistic probe suggested that participation of multiple active oxidants NiII−OOC(O)R 2, NiIV-Oxo 3, and NiIII-Oxo 4 within olefin epoxidation reactions by the nickel porphyrin complex is markedly affected by solvent polarity, concentration, and type of substrate. In aprotic solvent systems, such as toluene, CH2Cl2, and CH3CN, multiple oxidants, NiII−(O)R 2, NiIV-Oxo 3, and NiIII-Oxo 4, operate simultaneously as the key active intermediates responsible for epoxidation reactions of easy-to-oxidize substrate cyclohexene, whereas NiIV-Oxo 3 and NiIII-Oxo 4 species become the common reactive oxidant for the difficult-to-oxidize substrate 1-octene. In a protic solvent system, a mixture of CH3CN and H2O (95:5), the NiII−OOC(O)R 2 undergoes heterolytic or homolytic O−O bond cleavage to afford NiIV-Oxo 3 and NiIII-Oxo 4 species by general acid catalysis prior to direct interaction between 2 and olefin, regardless of the type of substrate.

As a next-generation power system, the Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system, which requires a multi-stage turbine or a supersonic turbine to generate a high power, has been shown to have high potential for such uses. In this paper, a dense gas is chosen as a working fluid and a supersonic nozzle is designed for a supersonic turbine with advantages in terms of cost, power density and layout. Two stators are designed using the Method of characteristics (MOC) for air and dense gas. To validate the numerical model, the nozzle designed for the air is compared to that of a PIV experiment from the open literature, and the results indicate a reasonable agreement. The nozzle for the dense gas is different as that needed for air. Therefore, the modified MOC is applied based on a polytropic assumption. In conclusion, an estimation of the performance is implemented with loss coefficients for a different number of blades. The number of blades is shown to be proportional to the loss coefficient. For example, the case with the biggest numbers of blades is affected the most by the shock effect that occurs at the trailing edge. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Computational fluid dynamics; Dense gas; Polytropic process; R245fa; Supersonic turbine stator","Computational fluid dynamics; Gases; Nozzles; Numerical methods; Rankine cycle; Stators; Dense gas; Loss coefficients; Method of characteristics; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Polytropic process; R245fa; Renewable energies; Supersonic nozzles; Turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029945720

The primary features of the developed robot are divided into three parts. First, the developed robot is worn on the patient's chest, as opposed to the conventional elbow crutch that is attached to the forearm; hence, it can effectively disperse the patient's weight throughout the width of the chest, and eliminate the concentrated load at the elbow. Furthermore, it allows free arm motion during walking. Second, the developed robot can recognize the walking intention of the patient from the magnitude and direction of the ground reactive forces. This is done using three-axis force sensors attached to the feet of the robot. Third, the robot can perform a stair walking function, which can change vertical movement trajectories in order to step up and down a single stair according to the floor height. Consequently, we experimentally showed that the developed robot can effectively perform walking rehabilitation assistance by perceiving the walking intention of the patient. Moreover we quantitatively verified muscle power assistance by measuring the electromyography (EMG) signals of the muscles of the lower limb. © 2017 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Legged; Walking Rehabilitation; Wearable Robot","Electromyography; Intelligent robots; Muscle; Robots; Stairs; Walking aids; Concentrated load; Legged; Rehabilitation robot; Robot technology; Three-axis force sensors; Vertical movement; Walking intentions; Wearable robots; Patient rehabilitation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029583856

Since a wide range of various nZVI-containing materials have been developed for effective remediation, it is necessary to determine an appropriate way to terminate the reactivity of any nZVI-containing material for a practical experimental procedure. In this study, bimetallic Ni/Fe-NPs were prepared to enhance overall reduction kinetics owing to the catalytic reactivity of nickel on the surface of nZVI. We have tested several chemical strategies in order to terminate nZVI reactivity without altering the concentration of volatile compounds in the solution. The strategies include surface passivation in alkaline conditions by addition of carbonate, and consumption of nZVI by a reaction competitor. Four halogenated chemicals, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, atrazine, and 4-chlorophenol, were selected and tested as model groundwater contaminants. Addition of carbonate to passivate the nZVI surface was not effective for trichloroethylene. Nitrate and then bromate were applied to competitively consume nZVI by their faster reduction kinetics. Bromate proved to be more effective than nitrate, subsequently terminating nZVI reactivity for all four of the tested halogenated compounds. Furthermore, the suggested termination method using bromate was successfully applied to obtain trichloroethylene reduction kinetics.

A one-pad top foil forms the bearing surface, under which the bearing structure and a bearing housing are located. Test bearings include gas foil bearings (GFBs), gas polymer bearings (GPBs), and gas foil-polymer bearings (GFPBs). In addition, three metal shims were employed to create wedge effects in the GFPBs. First, static load-deflection tests of test bearings estimate the radial assembly clearance. Second, shake dynamic loading tests identify frequency-dependent dynamic characteristics. An electromagnetic shaker provides flat bearing specimens with one degree-of-freedom (1DOF) vertical dynamic loading. GFPB was measured to exhibit a higher structural damping and lower stiffness than GFB. Lastly, the electric motor driving tests examine the rotordynamic stability performance. A permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor drives a PM rotor supported on a pair of test journal bearings. As a result, the GFPBs with mechanical preloads enhanced the rotordynamic performance with no subsynchronous motions up to the maximum rotor speed of 88 krpm, and the bearing friction characteristics as well. Furthermore, they showed comparable rotordynamic performance to three-pad GFBs from a past literature, even with larger bearing clearances and small mechanical preloads. © 2017 by ASME.","bearing friction; dynamic loading; gas foil bearing; polymer; rotordynamic instability","Bearings (machine parts); Damping; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Electric drives; Electric motors; Friction; Gases; Journal bearings; Permanent magnets; Polymers; Synchronous motors; Traction motors; Bearing friction; Dynamic loadings; Gas foil bearing; One degree of freedom (1-DOF); Performance measurements; Permanent magnet synchronous motors; Rotordynamic; Vertical dynamic loading; Foil bearings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022059265

Shape functions for polyhedral elements are derived from moving least square approximation based on a tetrahedral subdivision of polyhedral domains by a centroid-based subdivision technique.

In this method, the signed distances (level set values) to an interface are to be computed for all of the nodes inside a narrow band. In the 2D case, simple geometrical relations are employed for efficient calculation of the distance from a node inside a narrow band of an interface segment to the segment without finding the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the node onto the line including the interface segment. In the 3D case, an algorithm similar to the algorithm for the 2D case is introduced to determine nodes with feet far from the interface segment quickly. For the remaining nodes, a new technique to determine the existence of the foot on the interface segment is proposed in the re-initialization procedure. Benchmark problems with prescribed velocities are simulated to validate the proposed method for various mesh resolutions. The proposed method is not only demonstrated to be accurate but also highly efficient.

However, the corrosive nature of the chloride ion and Al2Cl7 − makes it challenging to find suitable current collectors and cathode materials. Here, we screen various metals and carbon materials as current collectors, and indeed find that none of the metals commonly used for battery current collectors is stable against corrosion from the electrolyte. Only pyrolytic graphite is stable, but exhibits undesired AlCl4 − intercalation at 1.7 V vs. Al/Al3+. The addition of lithium chloride (LiCl) salt to the electrolyte not only eliminates AlCl4 − intercalation through Li−AlCl4 − coordination, but also extends the stable voltage window to 2.3 V vs. Al/Al3+. Moreover, the incorporation of Li ions allows us to engage the established LiFePO4 olivine cathode in Li-ion batteries. This Al−Li hybrid cell exhibits an operation voltage of 1.3 V with robust cyclability (83.4 % retention after 400 cycles) and minimal self-discharge.

To collect information, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are exploited. The Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), one type of WSN, has been designed for long-range IoT services. It consumes low power and uses a low data rate for data transmission. The LPWAN includes several communication standards, and Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is the representative standard of the LPWAN. LoRaWAN provides several data rates for transmission and enables adaptive data rate control in order to maintain network connectivity. In the LoRaWAN, the wireless condition is considered by the reception status of the acknowledgement (ACK) message, and adaptive data rate control is performed according to the wireless condition. Because the judgment of the wireless condition by the reception status of ACK messages does not reflect congestion, adaptive data rate control can lead to inefficiency in data transmission. For efficient data transmission in long-range IoT services, this paper proposes a congestion classifier using logistic regression and modified adaptive data rate control. The proposed scheme controls the data rate according to the congestion estimation. Through extensive analysis, we show the proposed scheme's efficiency in data transmission. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive data rate control; Congestion identification; Data transmission; IoT; LPWAN","Adaptive control systems; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Wireless sensor networks; Acknowledgement (ACK); Communication standards; Congestion estimation; Data rate controls; Internet of Things (IOT); LPWAN; Network connectivity; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wide area networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019064323

However, most conventional D2D studies have emphasized one-to-one communications, in which only two D2D users directly communicate with each other. This is because these studies were focused on reducing interference between D2D users and base stations or cellular users via power allocation, interference cancellation, and so on. In this paper, however, we focus on multi-link D2D communication in cellular networks, in which more than two D2D users can exchange their information symbols simultaneously, such as a mesh network. Multi-link D2D communication requires a suitable transmission scheme for its efficiency and reliability; thus, we employ hybrid space-time block coding and spatial multiplexing (hybrid STBC–SM).

The proposed charger adopts sinusoidal charging to eliminate the use of electrolytic capacitors. A nonregulating series resonant converter is employed for isolation, thereby minimizing the ratings of the components and achieving zero-current switching turn on and off of switches. Meanwhile, an ac-dc converter is employed to control each mode and their mode changes, making the whole control scheme simple and the mode changes seamless.

Therefore, secure elements to protect against security threats are needed. In particular, Short Message Service phishing (Smishing) damage has continued to increase with the normalization of mobile computing environment. We discuss and analyze the security considerations about Smishing in mobile computing environments. In addition, we propose an enhanced security model for detecting Smishing attack (we called “S-Detector”). The proposed model is applied to a Naive Bayes classifier to improve the Smishing attack detection in smart devices. This model distinguishes normal text message and Smishing message.

The TE film was composed of stoichiometric Bi 2 Te 3 , synthesized by means of cost-effective electrochemical deposition onto a textured silicon wafer. The resulting pyramidally textured TE film played a critical role in maximizing hydrogen gas flow around the overlying Pt NFs, which were synthesized by means of electrospinning followed by sputtering and acted as a heating catalyst. The optimal temperature increase of the Pt NFs was determined by means of optimizations of the electrospinning and sputtering durations. The output voltage signal of the optimized TCH sensor based on Pt NFs was 17.5 times higher than that of a Pt thin film coated directly onto the pyramidal TE material by using the same sputtering duration, under the fixed conditions of 3 vol% H 2 in air at room temperature. This observation can be explained by the increased surface area of (111) planes accessible on the Pt-coated NFs. The best response time and recovery time observed for the optimized TCH sensor based on Pt-coated NFs were respectively 17 and 2 s under the same conditions.

This paper tries to investigate whether Korean households are willing to pay a premium for replacing their gas stoves, which are currently common in Korea, with induction cooktops, from the perspective of convenience and safety. To this end, a contingent valuation technique was applied to assess the additional willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for using an induction cooktop rather than a gas stove. A nationwide survey of 1000 households was carried out. The results indicate that the mean additional WTP for using an induction cooktop rather than a gas stove is KRW 207 (USD 0.19) per cubic meter of residential gas. This value can be interpreted as the convenience and safety benefits to the consumer of using an induction cooktop rather than a gas stove, or residential electricity rather than residential gas for cooking. It amounts to approximately 26.7% of the average 2015 price of residential gas, which was KRW 775 (USD 0.70) per cubic meter. If the gap between the price for residential electricity and the price for residential gas is less than the WTP value, households will increase their demand for residential electricity for cooking. © 2017 by the authors.","Convenience; Gas stove; Induction cooktop; Premium; Safety; Willingness to pay","commodity price; contingent valuation; cooking appliance; electricity; gas; household survey; replacement; safety; willingness to pay; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028603488

In the case of insufficient cash, a taxpayer can pay the government with listed or unlisted stocks (hereinafter referred to as ""tax payment in kind""). The drawback of this tax payment system is that receiving tax paid with stocks is subject to the valuation of the government and selling the stocks to an open market requires another valuation. The results of these two valuations show considerable differences, and, therefore, the selling price in the open market is very low. This study analyzes how taxpayers recognize the differences in the valuation results of these unlisted stocks and how the differences affect the pricing for repurchasing the stocks from the open market. Results show that high valuation of unlisted stocks in tax payment in kind drives buyers to lower the purchasing price in the open market.

Nevertheless, APC still encounters important challenges due to the limited amount of raw material resources. Herein, we propose a novel and simple approach to synthesize APC from tofu using a simple synthesis process involving carbonization with KOH activation. To obtain the optimized APC, three types of APCs are prepared using different weight ratios of 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5 (WTofu/WKOH) during the carbonization. The optimized APC electrode shows an outstanding specific capacitance of 207 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, a remarkable high-rate performance, an impressive energy density of 25.7–19.9 W h kg−1, and an excellent cycling stability for up to 2000 cycles. Therefore, this unique approach to obtain APC using tofu yield a material with some useful qualities in terms of an increased number of electroactive sites based on a high surface area, and an improved wettability based on the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the APC.

For fast AEP extraction, the effect of various noises such as motion artefact, eye blink, or power line noise should be minimised in the AEP recording. The existing fast AEP extraction methods that use the Kalman filter or wavelet transform have limitations owing to parametric arbitrariness. In this study, the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) in the time domain was adopted and optimised for AEP extraction with various types of noises. Moreover, the hardware architecture for an optimised SSA was implemented in an FPGA to realise real-time operation. The results show that the optimised SSA method can reduce the stimulus repetition by 61.2% compared with the conventional ensemble averaging and obtain the maximum similarity to the original AEP signal of 83.2%.

The Southern Ocean has cooled to -1.8oC over the past 30 million years, and the seawater had retained this cold temperature and isolated oceanic environment because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Notothenioids dominate Antarctic fish, making up 90% of the biomass, and all notothenioids have undergone molecular and ecological diversification to survive in this cold environment. Therefore, they are considered an attractive Antarctic fish model for evolutionary and ancestral genomic studies. Bathydraconidae is a speciose family of the Notothenioidei, the dominant taxonomic component of Antarctic teleosts. To understand the process of evolution of Antarctic fish, we select a typical Antarctic bathydraconid dragonfish, P. charcoti. Here, we have sequenced, de novo assembled, and annotated a comprehensive genome from P. charcoti. The draft genome of P. charcoti is 709 Mb in size. The N50 contig length is 6145 bp, and its N50 scaffold length 178 362 kb. The genome of P. charcoti is predicted to contain 32 712 genes, 18 455 of which have been assigned preliminary functions. A total of 8951 orthologous groups common to 7 species of fish were identified, while 333 genes were identified in P. charcoti only; 2519 orthologous groups were also identified in both P. charcoti and N. coriiceps, another Antarctic fish. Four gene ontology terms were statistically overrepresented among the 333 genes unique to P. charcoti, according to gene ontology enrichment analysis. The draft P. charcoti genome will broaden our understanding of the evolution of Antarctic fish in their extreme environment. It will provide a basis for further investigating the unusual characteristics of Antarctic fishes. © The Author 2017.","Antarctic dragonfish; De novo genome assembly; Genome annotation; Notothenioid; Parachaenichthys charcoti","contig; genomic DNA; Antarctica; Article; DNA sequence; gene ontology; genome; genome size; nonhuman; Notothenia coriiceps; Parachaenichthys charcoti; priority journal; teleost; animal; biology; classification; fish; gene library; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; high throughput sequencing; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; phylogeny; procedures; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Fishes; Gene Library; Genetic Variation; Genome; Genome Size; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042182148

To detect an abnormal state of a turnout, turnout clearance detectors are widely used. These devices consider a failure of a turnout clearance detectors to be a failure of the turnout system, that could hinder train operations. Analysis of turnout clearance detector failures is very important to ensure normal train operation. We categorized failures of detectors into four groups to identify failure characteristics of the 140 detectors, which are composed of main line detectors (A), side tracks (B), detectors that are in operation more than 80 times a day (C) and detectors that are in operation fewer than 10 times per day. Failures of detectors have mainly been caused in the control part, in the cables and sensors; failures are classified into four groups (A, B, C and D). We have tried to find failure density distributions for each type of failures, inferring the parameter distributions a priori. Finally, using the Bayesian inference we proposed a maintenance time for control parts through the mean time of the detector, life and the life expectancy. © 2017 The Korean Society for Railway.

Linear regression models have some difficulties in classifying accident severity, but a logistic regression model can be used to overcome the weaknesses of linear regression models. The logistic regression model is applied to escalator (E/S) accidents in all stations on 5~8 lines of the Seoul Metro, using data mining techniques such as logistic regression analysis. The forecasting variables of E/S accidents in urban railway stations are considered, such as passenger age, drinking, overall situation, behavior, and handrail grip. In the overall accuracy analysis, the logistic regression accuracy is explained 76.7%. According to the results of this analysis, it has been confirmed that the accuracy and the level of significance of the logistic regression analysis make it a useful data mining technique to establish an accident severity prediction model for urban railway casualty accidents. © 2017 The Korean Society for Railway.

In Korea, the capacity of load resistance is mainly considered in the design of anchors. However, the vibration resistance characteristics of anchors have not been fully elucidated. The traditional type of anchor, which is a frictional resistance anchor, is often reported to fail due to vibration in construction procedures, such as blasting. The expansion type of anchor, on the other hand, could have more resistance to vibration but its capability of demonstrating vibratory resistance has to be investigated. In order to verify the vibratory resistance characteristics of expansion anchors against blasting and earthquake vibration, field tests and numerical analyses for seismic wave were performed. Field blasting test results show that the expansion anchor has better capability against vibratory load than does the frictional type anchor. Numerical analysis to earthquake also show that the expansion type anchor provides more resistance than does the frictional type anchor. © 2017 The Korean Society for Railway.

These problems are mainly caused by the erasebefore-write restriction of NAND flash memory. As the write to NAND is accumulated, a garbage collection is performed to reproduce clean blocks. The execution time of the garbage collection greatly depends on the association degree of the NAND blocks selected as victim. In other words, if the victim block has the high association degree, the execution time of the garbage collection becomes long, which adversely affects the overall performance of the memory card. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new hybrid mapping flash translation layer policy using dynamic active log pool, partial merge, and moving valid pages that reduce the association degree of victim blocks. The results of a trace-driven simulation show that the proposed policy reduces the worst-case latency of write requests by up to 44.8% compared to the best alternative policy. The average latency is also shortened by up to 4.1%. © 2017 IEEE.","Flash translation layer; Hybrid mapping; Memory cards; NAND flash memory; Worst-case performance","Mapping; Memory architecture; NAND circuits; Refuse collection; Virtual storage; Flash translation layer; Hybrid mapping; Memory card; NAND flash memory; Worst-case performance; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035814293

At 50 μM concentration, the cellular protective effect (τ50) of 70% ethanol extract, ethyl acetate fraction and aglycone fraction from lavender was 70.6, 87.2 and 165.2 min, respectively. In particular, the lavender aglycone fraction showed 3.8 times higher cellular protective effect than that of (+)-α-tocopherol. The lavender fractional components including luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, vitextin, rosmarinic acid, luteolin, and apigenin were identified using TLC and LC-MS. However, the lavender aglycone fraction did not show any significant increase in flavonoids (luteolin and apigenin) compared to that of the ethyl acetate fraction.

Several alternative flexible electrodes have been developed, but it is still difficult to successfully achieve high quality as good as ITO. In this study, we investigated the effects of the annealing temperature and the hard coating (HC) layer on flexibility of the ITO films. The flexibility of ITO films on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were investigated by the bending and fragmentation tests. As the annealing temperature increased, the bendability of the film generally increased due to the internal compressive stress of the film induced during annealing process. The ITO with the HC layer exhibited a lower bendability than ITO without the HC layer due to the brittle HC layer. On the other hand, the fragmentation tests indicated the existence of white spots or defects, which are the filler materials on PET, decreased the stretchability and adhesion strength of the ITO film. Addition of the HC layer on PET substrate is indispensable. However, development of a softer and more durable HC layer is required for the flexible ITO electrode.

The solid-state Ag dewetting behavior was found to be sensitive to temperature. The formation of bump-like structures on the particle surface and slight bonding between the particles were observed after heating for 20 min at 225 °C. After heating at 250 °C, a rougher surface, strong bonding between the particles, and out-diffusion of Cu through the Ag layer were observed. As a result, the outermost phase was determined to be a Cu2O phase. The bonding strength of the die increased with increasing bonding temperature and time. Although a die bonded for 20 min at 250 °C without the application of any bonding pressure initially exhibited a strength of 2.250 MPa, the strength increased to 19.991 MPa with increased displacement as a result of resin infiltration and curing.

The Cu bump, however, has a higher modulus compared to the solder bump and introduces high mechanical stress to a low-k layer in the chip. In this study, we investigated the low-k layer stress induced after reflow process. In particular, the effects of new technologies such as an oblong Cu bump and embedded trace substrate (ETS) on low-k layer stress were analyzed and compared with the conventional round Cu bump and substrate. For precise prediction of solder joint shape, Surface Evolver program was used. The effects of the Cu bump height and solder resist opening (SRO) diameter on the low-k layer stress were investigated. The oblong bump showed a low-k layer stress of 10% lower than the round bump, and ETS showed a low-k layer stress of 23% lower than the conventional substrate. Therefore, the employment of the oblong bump and ETS is very effective in reducing the low-k stress. In general, increasing the Cu bump height and decreasing the SRO diameter will reduce the low-k layer stress.

Previously developed wearable robots have generally used motors and gears to assist muscle power during walking. However, the combination of motor and reduction gear is heavy and has limitations on the simultaneous control of stiffness and torque due to the friction of the gear reducer unlike human muscles. Therefore, in this study, Mckibben pneumatic muscle, which is lighter, safer, and more powerful than an electric motor with gear, was used to assist ankle joint. Antagonistic actuation using a pair of pneumatic muscles assisted the power of the soleus muscles and tibialis anterior muscles used for the pitching motion of the ankle joint, and the model parameters of the antagonistic actuator were experimentally derived using a muscle test platform. To recognize the wearer's walking intention, foot load and ankle torque were calculated by measuring the pressure and the center of pressure of the foot using force and linear displacement sensors, and the stiffness and the torque of the pneumatic muscle joint were then controlled by the calculated ankle torque and foot load. Finally, the performance of the developed ankle power assistive robot was experimentally verified by measuring EMG signals during walking experiments on a treadmill. © 2017 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Ankle power assistance; Pneumatic muscle; Wearable robot","Pneumatic actuators; Pneumatic control; Pneumatic equipment; Pneumatics; Robots; Stiffness; Torque; Walking aids; Wearable technology; Center of pressure; Linear displacement sensor; Pneumatic muscle; Power assistance; Power assistive robot; Simultaneous control; Walking intentions; Wearable robots; Muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029224591

The Korean government thus plans to expand the DHS and requires information about the value that consumers place on the DHS over the IHS, which has not been dealt with in academic literature. This paper attempts to investigate Korean households' willingness to pay (WTP) for DHS over IHS, for residential heat (RH). To this end, the authors apply the dichotomous choice contingent valuation to assessing additional WTP for DHS using a survey of 1000 randomly selected households living in buildings with IHS. A mixture model is applied to deal with the zero WTP responses. The WTP distribution is specified as a mixture of two distributions, one with a point mass at zero and the other with full support on the positive half of the real line. The results show that the mean additional WTP for DHS-based RH over IHS-based RH is estimated to be KRW 5775 (USD 5.4) per Gcal. This value can be interpreted as the consumer's convenience benefits of DHS over IHS, and amounts to approximately 6.0% of the average price: KRW 96,510 (USD 90.4) per Gcal in 2013, for IHS-based RH. This information is useful for evaluating changes to the method used for supplying RH from IHS to DHS. © 2017 by the authors.

MR-WPT can be used in many applications for charging mobile devices, such as laptop computers, tablet PCs, and smartphones. We proposed a wireless power-charging system from a transmitter on a desk or table to the receiver imbedded on a laptop computer. However, transfer efficiency decreased because of the misalignment between the movable receiver and the transmitter. This misalignment could have undue influence on the transfer power of MR-WPT. To verify the effect of a misalignment of resonators on MR-WPT, we simulated mutual inductance according to the misaligned distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Moreover, we experimentally proved this relationship through a practical laptop model with an SGR in MR-WPT. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","magnetic resonance; misalignment; slit ground resonator; transfer efficiency; wireless power transfer","Alignment; Efficiency; Energy transfer; Inductance; Inductive power transmission; Magnetic resonance; Personal computers; Resonators; Transmitters; Charging systems; misalignment; Mutual inductance; Tablet PCs; Transfer efficiency; Wireless power; Wireless power transfer; Laptop computers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019656848

This tread has grooves with complicated shapes, which are formed by a mold during the shaping process. When the tread rubber does not fill the mold properly, tire quality deteriorates crucially. As such, it is important to observe the flow of the tread rubber during the shaping process. To determine the flow of tread rubber in the mold, we conducted an experiment and computer simulation with white rubber strips inserted into specific areas of the tread. The white rubber strips showed detailed flow behavior of the tread rubber visually in the mold during the shaping process. No significant flows were observed for rubber in the central area of each block of the mold, but more changes were found near the edges of each block. The strips of rubber below the grooves exhibited more significant changes as they were pressed down by the protruding area of the mold. Moreover, there was no flow of rubber between blocks in the mold. This implies the profile design of the extruded tread should match the mold profile and the volume of each block. The experiment and simulation had similar results, and the observations of rubber flow in the mold using simulation proved to be highly useful. © 2017","Computer simulation; Green tire; Shaping process; Tire tread; Tread rubber; White rubber strip","Computer simulation; Green computing; Molds; Tires; Complicated shape; Flow behaviors; Green tires; Profile designs; Shaping process; Specific areas; Tire tread; White rubber strip; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019652556

Thus, one of the major challenges remaining in this field is the structural design of a biomimetic scaffold that satisfies the specific requirements for osteochondral repair. To address this hurdle, a bio-inspired multilayer osteochondral scaffold that consisted of the poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and the hydroxyapatite (HA)/PCL microspheres, was constructed via selective laser sintering (SLS) technique. The SLS-derived scaffolds exhibited an excellent biocompatibility to support cell adhesion and proliferation in vitro. The repair effect was evaluated by implanting the acellular multilayer scaffolds into osteochondral defects of a rabbit model. Our findings demonstrated that the multilayer scaffolds were able to induce articular cartilage formation by accelerating the early subchondral bone regeneration, and the newly formed tissues could well integrate with the native tissues. Consequently, the current study not only achieves osteochondral repair, but also suggests a promising strategy for the fabrication of bio-inspired multilayer scaffolds with well-designed architecture and gradient composition via SLS technique. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gradient microsphere scaffold; Hydroxyapatite; Osteochondral defects; Poly(ε-caprolactone); Selective laser sintering","3D printers; Biocompatibility; Biomimetics; Cartilage; Cell adhesion; Defects; Histology; Hydroxyapatite; Laser heating; Microspheres; Multilayers; Repair; Sintering; Structural design; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; Biomimetic scaffolds; Caprolactone; Hierarchical architectures; Hierarchical structures; Osteochondral defects; Osteochondral repairs; Poly (epsiloncaprolactone); Selective laser sintering; Scaffolds (biology); hydroxyapatite; microsphere; polycaprolactone; biomaterial; biomimetic material; polyester; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; articular cartilage; biocompatibility; bone development; bone regeneration; bone remodeling; cell adhesion; cell counting; cell proliferation; chondrogenesis; controlled study; in vitro study; laser; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; porosity; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rabbit model; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; selective laser sintering; surgical technique; tissue scaffold; animal; bone regeneration; cell culture technique; cell line; chemistry; cytology; human; Leporidae; mechanics; mesenchymal stroma cell; physiology; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Biomimetic Materials; Bone Regeneration; Cartilage, Articular; Cell Adhesion; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Durapatite; Humans; Lasers; Mechanical Phenomena; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Microspheres; Osteogenesis; Polyesters; Porosity; Rabbits; Rats; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019589885

However, it is quite difficult to obtain the reliable estimations for pipe-in-pipes (PIPs) from the existing solutions, because the PIPs show significantly different behaviors compared to the single-walled piping components due to the restraint effect induced by the outer pipe of the PIP. In this paper, the estimation schemes for the stress behaviors of the PIPs were proposed based on the detailed finite element (FE) analyses. In order to quantify the restraint effect, the FE analyses were conducted by considering various geometric variables of the PIPs under an internal pressure and a global bending moment. Based on the FE results, the tabular and closed-form solutions of the SIFs of PIPs were newly proposed. Finally, the proposed SIF estimations were validated against numerical results.

Additional, the switch-voltage stress is reduced due to the clamping circuit, and the reverse-recovery problem of the output diode is alleviated by the leakage inductor.

The conventional anti-islanding method based on the magnitude and frequency of voltage variation cannot applied to the indirect current control.

However, existing legacy devices are not old-fashioned or obsolete to use. From the perspective of sustainable information technology (IT), energy-efficient virtualization can apply a way to increase reusability for special customized devices and enhance the security of existing legacy devices. It means that the virtualization can customize a specially designed purpose using the guest domain from obsolete devices. Thus, this could be a computing scheme that keeps energy supplies and demands in balance for future sustainable IT. Moreover, energy-efficient virtualization can be the long-term and self-sustainable solution such as cloud computing, big data and so forth. By separating the domain of the host device based on virtualization, the guest OS on the segmented domain can be used as a Trusted Execution Environment to perform security features. In this paper, we introduce a secure platform to protect sensitive user data by domain isolation utilizing virtualization. The sensitive user data on our secure platform can protect against the infringement of personal information by malicious attacks.

The multilayer graphene sheets are successfully grown on the Ni-foam substrate surface, maintaining the unique 3D macroporous structure of the Ni foam. The potential use of GMF electrodes in nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) is carefully examined using [Co(bpy)3]+/2+ and [Fe(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couples. The GMF electrodes display a much improved electrochemical activity and enhanced kinetics toward the [Co(bpy)3]+/2+ (anolyte) and [Fe(bpy)3]2+/3+ (catholyte) redox couples, compared with the bare Ni metal foam electrodes, suggesting that the 2D graphene sheets having lots of interdomain defects provide sufficient reaction sites and secure electric-conduction pathways. Consequently, a nonaqueous RFB cell assembled with GMF electrodes exhibits high Coulombic and voltage efficiencies of 87.2 and 90.9%, respectively, at the first cycle. This performance can be maintained up to the 50th cycle without significant efficiency loss.

According to investigations, Pd2Bi1/C catalyst including low Pd amount promotes oxygen desorption with enhancement in CO poisoning resistance. With that, indirect formic acid oxidation reaction (IFAOR) and its stability are improved. To further improve the FAOR, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) surfactant is contained due to its amphiphilic property reducing Bi aggregation. To determine optimal amount of the PVP, analysis using TEM and XPS is performed and the results are verified by density functional theory (DFT). According to TEM, in 0.22 PVP-Pd2Bi1/C catalyst, PdBi has small size (∼5 nm) and is well-dispersed with widest Ed- EF of 3.85 eV, proving the catalyst induces effective CO-poisoning resistance and less Bi aggregation. These results are also compatible with trend in FAOR measured by cyclic voltammogram (CV). Even long-term stability, the catalyst maintains catalytic activity well.

It adopts the cascaded control scheme, which consists of an inner model predictive torque control (MPTC) loop and outer model predictive speed control (MPSC) loop using two individual cost functions. This control approach implements a maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operation in a wide speed range, which includes flux-increased and flux-limited modes. The MPSC produces the required torque to drive the IM at the reference speed. This torque is taken as the input of the inner MPTC, which in turn generates the optimal finite set of control input voltage. The control signals of the two MPC are constrained with the maximum limits of the system. The state feedback is achieved with a standard Kalman Filter, which estimates the non-measured load torque. The proposed control system is implemented and validated in experimental environment. The behaviour of the control system is evaluated by applying reference and disturbance steps to the system in different operational modes. © 2017","FCS-MPC; Induction Motor; MTPA; Speed Control; Torque Control","Cost functions; Electric machine theory; Induction motors; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Speed; Speed control; State feedback; Torque; Torque control; Cascaded controls; Experimental environment; FCS-MPC; Finite control set; Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operations; MTPA; Operational modes; Standard Kalman filters; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031788631

This equation is not suitable for multi-view 3D display with larger view number as it gives the inappropriately large value. In 3D display using eyeglass, double images occur at large depth. But, in multi-view 3D display with larger view number, blur occurs to larger width for the larger depth. Hence, blur phenomenon of multi-view 3D display was investigated to understand the unique characteristics of multi-view 3D display. For this purpose, ray tracing S/W was used to simulate 3D display image seen at the designed viewing distance, to calculate the relative luminance distribution, and to quantify the relation between blur and depth. Calculated results showed that incomplete image separation caused the overlap of multiple view images and the blur. Blur edge width (BEW) was proportional to the horizontal disparity and related to the depth. BEWR = (BEW) / (binocular disparity) was newly defined, and its usefulness for 3D characterization was investigated.

Metal and plastics can be attached by metal insert molding after insertion the metal in the cavity of mold without any additional processes. However, the adhesion strength at the interface between metal and plastics can be weakened by shrinkage difference and dissimilar characteristics of two materials. In this study, adhesion strengths for metal insert molded specimens have been investigated with variously surface treated metal plates. Surface treatments of metal surfaces were done by etching, sand blasting, and laser machining. Adhesion strengths were diverse according to the surface treatment of metal and they depended upon surface morphology.

Therefore, this study aims to resolve the issue that limits the usability of the CNC engraving machine.

Second, computer-aided process planning (CAPP) steps such as tool path generation, workpiece clamping, and corresponding coordinate system are automated by compromising productivity and efficiency. As a result, a CNC engraving machine system that can be easily used by non-experts was developed.

This paper proposes a mobile-side solution for the concurrent use of multiple radios in a performance-aware and energy-efficient manner, with which a mobile station activates and deactivates radio interfaces dynamically according to traffic demands and a predicted capacity gain. To this end, the proposed solution is composed of multiple prediction algorithms and a control algorithm. Prediction when activating an additional radio interface is relatively difficult since no information of the disabled interface's current status (and the corresponding frequency channel's) is available at the time of prediction. Our experiments show that, despite different types and used channels, different radio interfaces have a strong correlation of received signal strengths and used PHY rates between them. Based on this observation, the proposed solution learns a correlation pattern between interfaces whenever multiple interfaces are active and makes prediction of the coverage, expected PHY rate and capacity impact of an inactive interface based on the learned correlation with a currently active interface. The design of the prediction algorithms are based on a simple or machine-learning technique (SVM). The control algorithm then keeps monitoring the utilization of active interfaces and, if any of them has utilization over a threshold, checks if each inactive interface is within coverage and a valid rate range based on an active interface's received signal strength. Finally, an action of a configuration change (either activation, deactivation, or no change) selected based on the prediction of the resulting capacity is applied. Testbed experiments using COTS dual-band Wi-Fi interfaces demonstrate that the solution can enhance throughput by up to 29.6 percent (in a close distance to AP) and at most halve power consumption compared to legacy aggregation while the gain varies depending on the location and traffic conditions. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Link aggregation; multipath TCP; multiple radio interfaces; Wi-Fi aggregation","Chemical activation; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Learning systems; Radio systems; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Communication capacity; Concurrent exploitation; Link aggregation; Machine learning techniques; Multipath TCP; Multiple radios; Performance deterioration; Received signal strength; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027496345

The typical four resonator MR-WPT (Tx part: source loop and Tx coil; Rx part: Rx coil and load loop) is difficult to apply to small-sized stationary and mobile applications, such as laptop computers, tablet-PCs, and smartphones, owing to the large volume of the Rx part and the spatial restrictions of the Tx and Rx coils. Therefore, an L-shape structure, which is the orthogonal arrangement of the Tx and Rx parts, is proposed for indoor environment applications, such as at an Lshaped wall or desk. The relatively large Tx part and Rx coil can be installed in the wall and the desk, respectively, while the load loop is embedded in the small stationary or mobile devices. The transfer efficiency (TE) of the proposed system was measured according to the transfer distance (TD) and the misaligned locations of the load loop.

Natural convection and conduction of water inside the pipe was coupled with the conduction of the pipe whose bottom was subject to uniform heat source. From the present grid resolution and time-step independent solutions, it has been confirmed that the water temperature inside a PVC pipe was higher than that inside a steel pipe due to the smaller heat capacity of PVC and that the streamline patterns of the two cases were found to be opposite because the thermal diffusivity of steel (PVC) is larger (smaller) than that of water such that steel (PVC) pipe is heated faster (slower) than water. Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of heat flux to water was performed by examining the distributions of the heat flux along the inside walls of steel/PVC. The average temperature of water inside steel was found to be higher than that inside PVC at the initial stage of heating.

Recently, armor materials have been required to have various properties such as hardness, strength, and impact toughness in order to maintain an excellent ballistic resistance even after impact. In the present study, the influence of tempering on the microstructure and mechanical properties of an ARMOX 500T armor steel plate was investigated and then compared with those of S45C and SCM440 steels. As the tempering temperature increased, the hardness and strength gradually decreased, whereas the ductility and impact toughness clearly increased because the hardness, tensile, and impact properties were affected by the microstructural evolution and precipitation occurring during tempering. On the other hand, temper embrittlement appeared at tempering temperatures of 300 to 400 oC for the impact specimens tested at low temperature. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Armor plate; ARMOX 500T; Hardness; Impact toughness; Tempering","Armor; Ballistics; Fracture toughness; Hardness; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Armor plate; ARMOX 500T; Ballistic penetration; Ballistic resistance; Metallic material; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Temper embrittlement; Tempering temperature; Tempering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026453082

In this study, we have investigated semiconducting SnO2 thin films as friction layers in TEGs, which has not been explored thus far. Thin films of SnO2 with various thicknesses were grown by atomic layer deposition on Si substrates. Either polymer or glass was used as counter friction layers. Vertical contact/separation mode was utilized to evaluate the TEG efficiency. The results indicate that an increase in the SnO2 film thickness from 5 to 25 nm enhances the triboelectric output voltage of the TEG. Insertion of a 400-nm-thick Pt sub-layer between the SnO2 film and Si substrate further increased the output voltage up to ~120 V in a 2 cm × 2 cm contact area, while the enhancement was cancelled out by inserting a 10-nm-thick insulating Al2O3 film between SnO2 and Pt films.

First, an early bubble check is presented to reduce the initialization latency of the check node processing (CNP). Second, the CNP and variable node processing (VNP) are overlapped with the proposed backward memory scan method to hide the CNP latency within the VNP.

Moreover, the relatively small capacitance can be utilized by the output capacitor, as the output inductor current ripple is significantly reduced by the additional circuit, unlike in the conventional LED driver.

To achieve efficient data dissemination, nodes need to reconstruct their routes toward the latest location of the mobile sink, which weakens the energy conservation aim. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient cluster-based dynamic routes adjustment approach (EECDRA) which aims to minimize the routes reconstruction cost of the sensor nodes while maintaining nearly optimal routes to the latest location of the mobile sinks. The network is divided into several equal clusters and cluster heads are selected within each cluster. We also set some communication rules that manage routes reconstruction process accordingly requiring only a limited number of nodes to readjust their data delivery routes toward the mobile sinks. Simulation results show that the mobile sinks for reducing reconstruction of route have improved the energy efficiency and prolonged lifetime of wireless sensor network. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering; Energy efficient; Mobile sink; Routes reconstruction; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Sensor nodes; Clustering; Communication rules; Dynamic network topology; Efficient data disseminations; Energy efficient; Mobile sinks; Reconstruction process; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008686881

In particular, security is a mandatory factor for communications and operations in these environments. However, the existing CPS security mechanism is not suitable to the telecommunication framework provided by the standards. In addition, random number function of high entropy must be used to enhance security with encrypted communications and must support perfect secrecy. Random number functions supported by the devices instead of servers do not have sufficient entropy. Entropy injection and seed replacement are also impractical. In this paper, we propose a security scheme which provides light-weight secure CPS information transmission and device control scheme in integration of CPS and cloud computing.

In the early years, ransomware has used e-mails as attack method. The most common spreading method was through spam mail or harmful websites. In addition, social networking sites or smartphone messages are used. Ransomware can encrypt the user’s files and issues a warning message to the user and requests payment through bitcoin, which is a virtual currency that is hard to trace. It is possible to analyze ransomware but this has its limitations as new ransomware is being continuously created and disseminated. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ransomware prevention system based on abnormal behavior analysis and detection in cloud analysis system—CloudRPS. This proposed system can defend against ransomware through more in-depth prevention. It can monitors the network, file, and server in real time. Furthermore, it installs a cloud system to collect and analyze various information from the device and log information to defend against attacks. Finally, the goal of the system is to minimize the possibility of the early intrusion. And it can detect the attack quickly more to prevent at the user’s system in case of the ransomware compromises. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Abnormal behavior; Cloud; Intrusion detection; Prevention system; Ransomware","Clouds; Economics; Electronic money; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Abnormal behavior; Attack methods; Cloud analysis; Log information; Prevention systems; Social networking sites; Virtual currency; Warning messages; Malware",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979642441

Due to the limitations of conventional thermal solutions, liquid cooling technology has become a field of great interest for IC thermal management. In this study, an on-chip liquid cooling module with three different through Si vias (TSVs) and a fixed microchannel structure has been fabricated on an Si wafer using deep reactive ion etching and anodic bonding, followed by a grinding and dicing process. Pressure drop, coolant flow, and temperature difference before and after liquid flow were experimentally measured. TSV depth and diameter have been shown to have little effect on the change of pressure drop; however, shallower TSV depth and larger TSV diameter led to improved liquid cooling performance.

To support the dynamically changing characteristics, we pre-construct an indoor route when the route is requested. Further, we dynamically update its internal path information when the route changes. The proposed method is suitable for both simple and complex large-scale indoor spaces, even when the related indoor maps are difficult to be used for navigation.

In particular, an advanced persistent threats (APT) attack is bringing out big social issues. The APT attack uses social engineering methods to target various systems for intrusions. It breaks down the security of the target system to leak information or to destroy the system by giving monetary damages on the target. APT attacks make relatively simple attacks such as spear phishing during initial intrusion but a back door is created by leaking the long-term information after initial intrusion, and it transmits the malicious code by analyzing the internal network. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on the decision tree using analysis of behavior information to detect APT attacks that intellectually change after intrusion into a system. Furthermore, it can detect the possibility on the initial intrusion and minimize the damage size by quickly responding to APT attacks. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Advanced persistent threats (APT); Behavior analysis; Decision tree; Intrusion detection","Computer crime; Decision trees; Malware; Mercury (metal); Network security; Security of data; Advanced persistent threats (APT); Behavior analysis; Information security area; Internal network; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious codes; Social engineering; Target systems; Intrusion detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952654353

Accreditation requires the successful implementation of 30 so-called Student Performance Criteria (SPCs). Similar to recent improvements to international architectural education, different principles of sustainability have been successfully implemented by the KAAB. This paper identifies eight sustainability-related SPCs that can be utilized to teach sustainability. The analysis of 48 accredited five-year architectural education program curricula in South Korea has revealed which sustainability-related SPCs are addressed each semester. Furthermore, the average number of credits per sustainability-related SPC in different course types, such as theory courses and design studios, has been identified. Theory courses with an emphasis on sustainability education have been defined as sustainability core courses. The results reveal that a majority of existing programs primarily address environmental aspects of sustainability. Furthermore, a sequential course structure analysis elucidates three main curriculum types, with different potential for integrated sustainability education in sustainability core courses and design studios: (i) sustainability core course preceding (high potential); (ii) sustainability core courses and design studio, accompanying (high potential); and (iii) sustainability core course following (low potential). © 2017 by the authors.","Architectural education accreditation; Curriculum & course structure; Design studio; Integration; Korea Architectural Accrediting Board (KAAB); Sustainable architecture; Theory courses","architectural design; curriculum; education; sustainability; theory; university sector; workplace; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021665353

Therefore, for a stable long-term cell operation, the improvement of mechanical properties of matrix is highly required. In this study, aluminum foam was used to enhance the mechanical strength of the matrix as a 3D (three dimensional) support structure. Unlikely conventional matrix (pure α-LiAlO2 matrix) which has paste-like structure at the MCFC operating temperature, Al foam-reinforced α-LiAlO2 matrix has significantly strong mechanical strength because the 3D network structure of Al foam can form the harden alumina skin layer during a cell operation. As a result, the mechanical strength of the Al foam-reinforced α-LiAlO2 matrix was enhanced by 9 times higher than the pure α-LiAlO2 matrix in a 3-point bending test. In addition, thermal cycle test showed notable cell stability due to strong mechanical strength of Al foam-reinforced α-LiAlO2 matrix.

Instead of using a planar elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane is used in this study) substrate, diverse relief structures are introduced to induce nonuniform and complex strain within the elastic substrate and thereby different distributions of the crack density of the AgNWs upon stretching, which plays an important role in the modulation of the gauge factor (GF). Analysis of the sensory layer and mechanical studies reveal that a lower height ratio and greater number of trenches enhance the sensor sensitivity, for example, reaching a GF of 926 at 9.6% in this study.

To comply with this public demand, the Korean government planned to implement a policy of restoring the destroyed tidal flats and utilizing them as ecological resources. Thus, this study seeks to examine the public willingness to pay (WTP) for carrying out the policy. For this purpose, we report the results of a contingent valuation survey conducted for 1000 Korean households in 2016. We used a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question to derive the WTP responses and applied a spike model to deal with zero WTP responses. The mean yearly WTP per household was computed to be KRW 2923 (USD 2.62) for the next ten years, which is statistically meaningful at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 55.4 billion (USD 49.6 million) per year.

We show here carbon nanotube (CNT)-embedded agarose gel composite fiber electrodes, with a diameter of 120 μm, consisting of 60 wt % CNTs that can serve as the basis for flexible and wearable fiber microsupercapacitors (mSCs). Via an extrusion process, CNT bundles are induced to align in an agarose filament matrix. Due to the shear alignment of the CNT bundles, the dehydrated filaments have an electrical conductivity as high as 8.3 S cm-1. The composite fiber electrodes are mechanically stable, enabling formation of twisted two-ply fiber mSCs integrated with a solid electrolyte. The fiber mSC shows a high capacitance (∼1.2 F cm-3), good rate retention (∼90%) at discharge current densities ranging from 5.1 to 38 mA cm-3, long cycle life under repeated charging/discharging (10% fade after 10 000 cycles) and good performance after at least 1000 cycles of deformation, with a radius of curvature of 12.3 mm (90° bend). After being coated with a thin layer of poly(dimethylsiloxane), the fiber mSCs could be cycled over 10 000 times under water. Impedance studies indicate that the superior performance is due to the high electrical conductivity along the aligned CNTs and the large electrode surface area that is accessible through the ion-conducting agarose. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","agarose; carbon nanotubes; electrodes; fibers; supercapacitors","Electric conductivity; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Extrusion; Fibers; Flowcharting; Nanotubes; Solid electrolytes; Supercapacitor; Wearable technology; Yarn; Agarose; Charging/discharging; Discharge current density; Electrical conductivity; Electrode surface area; High electrical conductivity; Mechanical flexibility; Microsupercapacitors; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020781852

The present AMR technique is implemented for two-dimensional/three-dimensional unstructured meshes and extended to multi-level refinement. Smooth variation of the element size is guaranteed near the interface region with the use of multi-level refinement. A Courant–Friedrich–Lewy condition for zone adaption frequency is newly introduced to obtain a mass-conservative solution of incompressible multiphase flows. Finite elements around the interface are dynamically refined using the classical element subdivision method. Accordingly, finite element method is employed to solve the problems governed by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, using the level set method for dynamically updated meshes. The accuracy of the adaptive solutions is found to be comparable with that of non-adaptive solutions only if a similar mesh resolution near the interface is provided. Because of the substantial reduction in the total number of nodes, the adaptive simulations with two-level refinement used to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with a free surface are about four times faster than the non-adaptive ones. Further, the overhead of the present AMR procedure is found to be very small, as compared with the total CPU time for an adaptive simulation. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These techniques suppress the interference significantly and increase output signal to interference-noise ratio (SINR).

The height at which the main speaker is installed is determined by the size of the screen, and an optimum vertical orientation angle can be found according to the ratio of the height of the main speaker to the distance to the audience to be covered. In the case of front-fill speakers, the delay must be applied to minimize the comb filtering due to the time difference with the main speaker.

However, Cu pillar bump technology faces several issues, such as interconnect shorting and higher low-k stress due to stiffer Cu pillar structure when the conventional reflow process is used. Therefore, the thermal compression bonding (TCB) process has been adopted in the flip chip attachment process in order to reduce the package warpage and stress. In this study, we investigated the package warpage induced during the TCB process using a numerical analysis.

The open-loop MIMO precoder technique has been adopted in next generation broadcasting systems, such as digital video broadcasting-next generation handheld (DVB-NGH) and advanced television systems committee (ATSC) 3.0 standards. Furthermore, in DVB-NGH and ATSC 3.0, cross-polarized antennas have been employed in order to overcome the insufficient antenna separation for co-polarized antennas, which can enhance the performance over high correlation and LOS conditions. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate the performance of the open-loop MIMO precoders with cross-polarized antennas over correlated channels with an LOS component. We first study the statistical property of the MIMO channel with cross-polarized antennas on the basis of the measurement-based channel model. Next, we derive pairwise error probability (PEP) of the SM with the open-loop MIMO precoder. Through the PEP derivation, we evaluate the performance of each open-loop MIMO precoder against the spatial correlations and LOS component with the effect of cross-polarized antennas.

This study investigated the effects of melanin extracts of GD on osteoblast differentiation and inhibition of osteoclast formation. MATERIALS/METHODS: The effects of the melanin extract of GD on human osteoblast MG-63 cell differentiation were examined by evaluating cell viability, osteoblast differentiation, and expression of osteoblast-specific transcription factors such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), small mothers against decapentaplegic homologs 5 (SMAD5), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin and type 1 collagen (COL-1) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis. We investigated the inhibitory effect of melanin on the osteoclasts formation through tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and TRAP stains in Raw 264.7 cell. RESULTS: The melanin extract of GD was not cytotoxic to MG-63 cells at concentrations of 50-250 μg/mL. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and bone mineralization of melanin extract-treated cells increased in a dose-dependent manner from 50 to 250 μg/mL and were 149% and 129% at 250 μg/mL concentration, respectively (P <0.05). The levels of BMP-2, osteocalcin, and COL-1 gene expression were significantly upregulated by 1.72-, 4.44-, and 2.12-fold in melanin-treated cells than in the control cells (P <0.05). The levels of RUNX2 and SMAD5 proteins were higher in melanin-treated cells than in control vehicle-treated cells. The melanin extract attenuated the formation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand-induced TRAP-positive multinucleated RAW 264.7 cells by 22%, and was 77% cytotoxic to RAW 264.7 macrophages at a concentration of 500 μg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the melanin extract promoted osteoblast differentiation by activating BMP/SMADs/RUNX2 signaling and regulating transcription of osteogenic genes such as ALP, type I collagen, and osteocalcin. These results suggest that the effective osteoblastic differentiation induced by melanin extract from GD makes it potentially useful in maintaining bone health. © 2017 The Korean Nutrition Society and the Korean Society of Community Nutrition.","Alkaline phosphatase; Cell differentiation; Melanin; Osteoblast",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020437950

As the service life of the underground thermal piping network has increased for more than 30 years, the maintenance of the underground thermal pipe has become an important issue. A variety of complex technologies are required for periodic inspection and operation management for the maintenance of the aged thermal piping network. Especially, it is required to develop a model that can be used for decision making in order to derive optimal maintenance and replacement point from the economic viewpoint in the field. In this study, the analysis was carried out based on the repair history and accident data at the operation of the thermal pipe network of five districts in the Korea District Heating Corporation. A failure probability model was developed by introducing statistical techniques of qualitative analysis and binomial logistic regression analysis. As a result of qualitative analysis of maintenance history and accident data, the most important cause of pipeline damage was construction erosion, corrosion of pipe and bad material accounted for about 82%. In the statistical model analysis, by setting the separation point of the classification to 0.25, the accuracy of the thermal pipe breakage and non-breakage classification improved to 73.5%. In order to establish the failure probability model, the fitness of the model was verified through the Hosmer and Lemeshow test, the independent test of the independent variables, and the Chi-Square test of the model. According to the results of analysis of the risk of thermal pipe network damage, the highest probability of failure was analyzed as the thermal pipeline constructed by the F construction company in the reducer pipe of less than 250mm, which is more than 10 years on the Seoul area motorway in winter. The results of this study can be used to prioritize maintenance, preventive inspection, and replacement of thermal piping systems. In addition, it will be possible to reduce the frequency of thermal pipeline damage and to use it more aggressively to manage thermal piping network by establishing and coping with accident prevention plan in advance such as inspection and maintenance.","Binary logistic regression analysis; District heating pipeline network; Thermal pipeline failure probability model; Thermal pipeline network failure causes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020250945

The microstructure was quantitatively analyzed using the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique, which clearly revealed a substantial amount of σ phase formed at the expense of δ ferrite during the service. Whereas the amount of σ phase precipitated after service corresponded to the fraction of the initial δ ferrite in the base metal, the fraction of the σ phase significantly exceeded the initial amount of δ ferrite in the weld metal. The simulation of long-term precipitation kinetics using MatCalc indicated that the nucleation of the σ phase occurred only in the δ ferrite in both the base and weld metals. The subsequent growth of the σ phase after the nucleation in δ ferrite was predicted to actively occur in austenite during the service.

This approach is proved to be delay and spectral efficient. Due to the nature of underlying Big data, such networks are prone to several security and privacy challenges. Because such gigantic data is not only difficult to store, maintain and manipulate but Big data’s open architecture makes the security threats inevitable. Therefore, incorporating authentication between mobile node and foreign network during roaming in ubiquitous networks has become a tedious task. Very recently, Farash et al. found a number of weaknesses in the schemes proposed by Wen et al. and Shin et al. Furthermore, Farash et al. proposed an enhanced scheme for roaming user in ubiquitous network. However, after thorough investigation, we show fragilities of Farash et al.’s scheme against (1) mobile user anonymity violation; (2) disclosure of secret parameter of mobile node; (3) session key disclosure; and (4) mobile node impersonation attacks. Therefore, we propose an improved scheme to fix these fragilities. We analyze the security of proposed scheme using popular automated verification tool ProVerif. The analysis confirms that the proposed scheme resists the known attacks while having quite low overhead as compared with Farash et al.’s scheme. Therefore, in order to get better performance proposed scheme is a suitable candidate to be employed along with supercomputing systems for dealing the security challenges of big data in ubiquitous networks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anonymity; Authentication; Big data systems; ProVerif; Roaming user; Ubiquitous networks","Aluminum; Authentication; Big data; Computer privacy; Data privacy; Mobile telecommunication systems; Ubiquitous computing; Anonymity; Data systems; Proverif; Roaming users; Ubiquitous networks; Network security",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014251807

Ubiquitous computing provides any services anywhere and anytime through networks conveniently to improve the quality of life of users. Ubiquitous computing is constructed via a variety of invisible sensors, networks, and computing environments. For multi-purpose sensors, deployment of the topology and topology lifetime are very important depending on wired or wireless sensors. Uneven energy consumption due to integrated routing sensors according to topology deployment types is a factor that degrades the quality of service (QoS) about user convenience services and lifetime of total topology. As a result, a number of studies on maximization of topology lifetime have been conducted. However, previous studies focused on deployment environments and limited sensors so that they cannot be deployed to real sites. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive power management scheme (APMS) that manages sensor power adaptively according to deployment environments to maximize topology lifetime. The APMS maximizes topology lifetime by changing routing paths according to lifetime log to manage sensor power. Furthermore, active responses for optimum topology can be achieved by deploying sensors via simulation prior to sensors deployed to the real environments by users. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud infrastructure; Graphic processing unit; Power management; Topology lifetime; Ubiquitous computing","Energy management; Energy utilization; Graphics processing unit; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Topology; Adaptive power management; Cloud infrastructures; Computing environments; Graphic processing units; Integrated routing; Optimum topologies; Real environments; Topology lifetime; Ubiquitous computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013804822

The powder mixture was successfully consolidated by spark plasma sintering yielding a sound microstructure comprising the intermetallic phase T2-Mo3Si uniformly distributed in a continuous matrix of α-Mo. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrogen reduction; Microstructure; Mo matrix; Mo-Si-B intermetallics; Pulverization","Ball milling; Comminution; Hydrogen; Ingots; Microstructure; Milling (machining); Molybdenum oxide; Powders; Silicon; Sintering; Soldering alloys; Spark plasma sintering; X ray diffraction analysis; High-energy ball milling; Homogeneous distribution; Hydrogen reduction; Intermetallic phase; Mo-Si-B; Pulverization; Spark plasma sintering process; X ray diffractometry analysis; Intermetallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011308865

Due to the brittleness of the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, several alternative TCEs have been developed. However, it is still difficult to successfully achieve quality as good as ITO. In this study, the flexibility of the ITO electrode was investigated with strain and fracture analysis. Effects of thickness of the ITO and the substrate on the flexibility of ITO were investigated by bending tests, numerical simulation and theoretical analysis. Flexibility of ITO electrode can be increased by reducing the thickness of ITO and substrate material. An ITO electrode with a substrate less than 50 μm could be bent to less than 4 mm without failure, and used in flexible electronics. Effects of different substrate materials on the flexibility of ITO were also investigated based on fracture analysis. We investigated the effects of PEDOT [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)] as a buffer layer to improve flexibility. Higher flexibility of the ITO/PEDOT hybrid electrode compared to ITO was attributed to the PEDOT layer, which smoothened ITO surface and decreased the density of pinholes or voids of ITO, resulting in higher crack resistance. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Bending tests; Electrodes; Electronic equipment; Flexible electronics; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Thermoelectric equipment; Tin oxides; Different substrates; Effects of thickness; Flexible electronic devices; Indium tin oxide electrodes; Numerical investigations; Poly-3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene; Substrate material; Transparent conductive electrodes; Substrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979998433

Microspeaker diaphragms have many applications in mobile media, and are generally manufactured from a thin polymer film using the thermoforming process. Thermoforming is a polymer processing method in which a polymer film is heated and softened to be formed into a desired shape. This process requires long cycle time because the polymer film should be heated enough to be softened before forming, and should be cooled sufficiently to be solidified after forming. In this study, ultrasonic vibration is applied to a thermoforming plug from which thin polymer films are shaped. For this purpose, an ultrasonic plug is designed to resonate at the excitation frequency of ultrasonic waves, and is applied to the thermoforming of a microspeaker diaphragm that incorporates a number of micro-corrugations. Considering that the cycle time of the proposed ultrasonic-assisted thermoforming process is <20 s owing to its localized heating capability, it can be concluded that the proposed process is superior to the conventional thermoforming process, the cycle time of which was as long as 160 s. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Diaphragms; Polymers; Semiconducting films; Thermoforming; Ultrasonic effects; Ultrasonic waves; Energy source; Excitation frequency; Localized heating; Long cycle time; Polymer processing; Rapid fabrication; Thin polymer films; Ultrasonic vibration; Polymer films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949661606

Though the development of microfluidics has enhanced the study of cellular lineage, it remains challenging to retrieve sister cells separately inside enclosed microfluidics for further analyses. In this work, we developed a photomechanical method to selectively detach and reliably retrieve target cells from enclosed microfluidic chambers. Cells cultured on carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane composite surfaces can be detached using shear force induced through irradiation of a nanosecond-pulsed laser.

One percent of Ca supplement significantly improved Ca content and bone strength of the tibia. In micro-computed tomography analysis, 1% Ca supplement attenuated OVX- and low Ca-associated changes in bone mineral density, trabecular thickness, spacing and number. Moreover, 1% Ca-supplemented diet increased the expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes, such as bone morphogenetic protein-2, Wnt3a, small mothers against decapentaplegic 1/5/8, runt-related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin and collagenase-1, while it decreased the expression of osteoclast differentiation genes, such as thrombospondin-related anonymous protein, cathepsin K and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B. Furthermore, 1% Ca-supplemented diet increased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The increased expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling were associated with significant increases in trabecular bone volume, which plays an important role in the overall skeletal strength. Our results demonstrated that 1% Ca supplement inhibited osteoclastogenesis, stimulated osteoblastogenesis and restored bone loss in OVX rats. © 2017 by the authors.

The two devices showed the typical oxygen-deficient conducting-filament (CF)-mediated bipolar resistance switching behaviour, which was induced by the asymmetric electrode configuration: Ta as the oxygen vacancy (VO) source/reservoir and TiN as the inert electrode. In these device geometries, the CF is supposed to initiate at the oxide/TiN interface and to grow towards the Ta electrode during the switch-on process, while the switch-off process was induced by the contraction of the CF from the Ta/oxide interface. Both devices, however, showed inversion (anomalous SET; switching from the off- to on-state) behaviour in the RESET (switching from the on- to off-state) process, which can be explained by the authors' previous model of the hourglass-shaped CF. In this model, once the CF is ruptured, the RESET polarity bias makes the lower portion of the CF regrow to slightly reconnect such a CF through the accelerated migration of VO from the upper-portion CF to the lower-portion CF, which induces switching performance degradation. In the I-V sweeps, the on- and off-states of the devices showed an overall conductance difference approximately corresponding to the integer multiple values of quantum point contact (G0), but there were arbitrary 0.25 and 0.125G0 differences in the conductance values of the on-state for the Ta2O5 and HfO2 devices, respectively. This suggests that these are the minimal units of conductance variation even for a given CF with a standard G0. Although the precise reason for the emergence of such an abnormal conductance unit is not yet understood, its implication for the reliability is critical. Reliable resistive switching was achieved only for the cases where the minimum point conductance was retained even in the off-state; in the other cases, over-SET and over-RESET were induced, which eventually degraded the device reliability. The detailed quantitative analysis of the device failure revealed that the increasing concentration of VO within the non-CF region in the cell decreased the resistance values of that region, which eventually resulted in the over-SET and over-RESET behaviours during the CLPS tests. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,"Electrodes; Electronic equipment testing; Hafnium oxides; Nonvolatile storage; Oxygen vacancies; Point contacts; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Random access storage; Reliability; Switching systems; Asymmetric electrodes; Bipolar resistance switching; Conducting filament; Device reliability; Quantum point contact; Resistive switching; Resistive switching memory; Switching performance; Switching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021808791

Thus, the consumers' preferences for eco-labeled products should be investigated to understand the potential of markets with green products. This study attempts to examine the consumers' preference or willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for eco-labeled products using a specific case study of a 43-inch LED TV, which is a common home appliance in Korea. For this purpose, a contingent valuation survey of 1000 Korean consumers was conducted in June 2016. We used a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question to derive the additional WTP responses and a spike model to analyze zero additional WTP responses. The mean additional WTP a premium for the eco-labeled 43-inch LED TV is estimated to be KRW29,007 (USD 24.8), which is statistically meaningful at the 1% level. This value amounts to 3.9% of the price of a conventional 43-inch LED TV (KRW750,000 or USD 640.5) and can be interpreted as the external benefit of an eco-labeled LED TV. We can conclude that Korean consumers are ready to pay a significant premium for eco-labeled LED TVs. Moreover, we examined the consumer's characteristics that affect the probability that the person will be willing to pay a premium for an eco-labeled LED TV and found that it would be effective to set high-income, older, highly-educated, and female consumers with children as marketing targets. © 2017 by the authors.","Consumer preference; Contingent valuation; Eco-labeled LEDTV; Premium; Willingness to pay","contingent valuation; ecolabeling; electrode; environmental economics; environmental values; marketing; probability; production cost; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; television; willingness to pay; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019936078

The policymakers are demanding information on the economic benefits of designating the island as an MPA. Therefore, this paper describes an attempt to measure the economic benefits, using a contingent valuation (CV) survey of 600 randomly selected households in Korea in 2015. We used a one-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice (DC) question to derive the willingness to pay (WTP) responses, and applied a spike model to deal with WTP responses of zero. The yearly mean WTP per household was computed to be KRW 3,590 (USD 3.15) for the next 10 years, an estimate that is statistically significant at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 67.2 billion (USD 59.1 million) per year. The present value of the total economic benefits amounts to KRW 534.0 billion (USD 469.2 million) using a social discount rate of 5.5%.

However, most safety education programs provided at elementary schools are unilateral and incorporate boring audiovisual aids. This study aims to suggest a board game for safety training which can be utilized for elementary school children to learn accident prevention and coping methods through playing games. Methods For the study, first, we elicited the categories of safety education contents and service items needed for safety education by analyzing the safety education contents and their service items on the web sites for organizations that provide safety education. Second, we analyzed major safety education contents and related board games. Third, based on the analysis of the above research, we created a board game design and its prototype. Fourth, we conducted service prototyping with elementary students and carried out brain wave measurement and interviews with them to verify the effectiveness and usability of the board game design. Lastly, we modified the prototype by taking into consideration of the evaluation results and suggested a final design for the board game. Results The results of an audio visual education and a safety training board game carried out in the first class and the second class respectively, and brain wave measurements and interviews conducted after playing the safety education board game revealed that the children had much interest in the safety education board game and responded to the alpha wave, which would improve their concentration and thinking abilities. Thus we determined that the safety board game was more effective for safety education than using typical audio visual contents. Conclusions The effectiveness of the safety board game through service prototyping of the game was verified. We expect this study will contribute to the safety of individuals, households and the country by providing effective safety education tools for elementary students.","Educational board game; Elementary school children; Safety training board game",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038403939

In communication systems that are available for feedback, precoding can enhance performance by exploiting channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. However, broadcasting systems have no reverse channel nor any CSI. Furthermore, channel mismatches in communication systems severely affect performance. For these systems, open-loop precoders that require no feedback CSI were proposed. However, an analytical precoder design method was not presented in the previous works. In this paper, we present an open-loop precoder design method for SMsystems with amaximum-likelihood receiver in transmit correlated MIMO channels. We first describe how to design an open-loop precoder using a rotational matrix over the amplitude of the correlation. Our precoder design method is derived by observing the effect of correlation mismatch between the feedback CSI and the actual channel condition on a minimum Euclidean distance-based precoder. Next, we present a method to design an open-loop precoder that takes into account the impact of the phase of the correlation. For this precoder, a phase rotation matrix is added on the rotational matrix, and optimum parameters are obtained by maximizing the worst-case minimum distance for the phase of the correlation. The simulation results illustrate the validity of proposed open-loop precoder in transmit correlated MIMO channels. © 2016 IEEE.","Channel correlation; Multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO); Open-loop MIMO; Open-loop precoder; Spatial multiplexing (SM)","Communication channels (information theory); Design; MIMO systems; Multiplexing equipment; Channel correlation; Multiple inputs; Open-loop; Pre coders; Spatial multiplexing; Channel state information",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022052244

However, in multichannel networks, broadcast efficiency is very poor as devices are distributed across various channels. Thus, a sender tries all channels to broadcast a single message, causing large overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel, drastically different scheme for efficient broadcast in multichannel networks. Our scheme leverages an overlapped band of adjacent channels, which is the frequency range that partially overlapped channels share within their channel boundaries. Specifically, a sender advertises a rendezvous channel through the overlapped band of adjacent channels; message sharing is done on the rendezvous channel. Our scheme employs signaling via overlapped band (SOB), which defines a new signal processing mechanism for communication via the overlapped band. SOB is integrated with the following Multiple Access Control (MAC) layer mechanisms: 1) Reserve idle spectrum fragment to reduce waiting time, 2) multisender agreement on rendezvous channel to support multisender broadcasts, and 3) reinforce switch notification to reduce the residing time at a wrong channel. Our scheme can also be integrated with two remarkably simple but efficient mechanisms for improving the packet delivery ratio and reducing delay in a multiple contention domain.We implemented our scheme on the SORA software radio platform. Experimental results validated communication through the overlapped band. Intensive simulation studies showed that our scheme dramatically outperformed a previous approach. © 2016 IEEE.","802.11 Wi-Fi; Broadcast; Multichannel wireless network; Overlapped band","Access control; Broadcasting; Information management; Radio broadcasting; Signal processing; Wireless networks; 802.11 wi-fis; Communication primitives; Multi-channel network; Multi-channel wireless networks; Multiple access control layers; Overlapped band; Packet delivery ratio; Software radio platform; Wi-Fi",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021728799

Most studies of RTS have focused on these criteria as primary design points. However, recent increases in security threats to various real-time systems have shown that enhanced security support must be included as an important design point, retro-fitting such support to existing systems as necessary. In this paper, we propose a new pre-flush technique referred to as flush task reservation for FP scheduling (FTRFP) to conditionally sanitize the state of resources shared by real-time tasks by invoking a flush task (FT) in order to mitigate information leakage/corruption of real-time systems. FTR-FP extends existing works exploiting FTs to be applicable more general scheduling algorithms and security model. We also propose modifications to existing real-time scheduling algorithms to implement a pre-flush technique as a security constraint, and analysis technique to verify schedulability of the real-time scheduling. For better analytic capability, our analysis technique provides a count of the precise number of preemptions that a task experiences offline. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed schedulability analysis improves the performance of existing scheduling algorithms in terms of schedulability and preemption cost.","Embedded software; Real-time systems; Scheduling algorithms; Security; System analysis and design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020105673

The corrugation density of one of the BPHE (Type II) was two times as high as that of the other BPHE (Type I). The hydraulic diameter of the type II BPHE was 2.13 mm, which was 38 % smaller than that of the type I BPHE. Also, the cross section shape of the flow channels for the type II BPHE was different from that for conventional BPHEs due to the unusual corrugation patterns and brazing points. The experimental conditions for temperatures were varied from 4.6 °C to 49.1 °C, and for mass flow rates were changed from 0.07 kg/s to 1.24 kg/s. The measured results showed that pressure drop in the type II BPHE was about 110 % higher than that in the type I BPHE. Nu of the type II was higher than that of the type I BPHE and the enhancement became larger with the increase of Re at the ranges above 800. New correlations for fF and Nu were proposed by this study and their prediction accuracy could be improved by considering the surface enlargement factor in the correlations. The performance evaluation of the two BPHEs was performed by (j/fF 1/3) which represented the ratio of heat transfer and pressure drop performance. Also, a new parameter, the capacity compactness of PHE, was proposed and it presented the PHE capacity per unit volume and unit log mean temperature difference. The comparison showed that the two BPHEs had similar values of the (j/fF 1/3), whereas they had significantly different values of the capacity compactness. The capacity compactness of the type II BPHE was 1.5 times higher than that for the type I BPHE. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Brazed plate heat exchanger; Capacity; Convection heat transfer; Fanning friction factor; Nusselt number; Pressure drop; Single-phase flow","Brazing; Drops; Flow control; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Nusselt number; Pressure drop; Thermal logging; Brazed plate heat exchanger; Capacity; Fanning friction factor; Heat transfer and pressure drop; Heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics; Log-mean temperature differences; Single-phase convections; Single-phase flow; Heat convection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019583058

Zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) technique and a dual-flyback module for reducing the number of snubber current paths are adopted to improve efficiency. For the ZVS technique, a self-driven synchronous rectifier (SR) is used instead of an output diode. By turning the self-driven SR off after a short delay, a main switch is turned on under the ZVS condition. For reducing the number of snubber current paths, a dual-flyback module and a snubber diode are used. When the main switch is turned off, leakage inductance energy is absorbed by a snubber diode into an input source and a primary dc-bus capacitor. Then, this energy is reprocessed by the dual-flyback dc-dc module to secondary side. Hence, there is only one snubber current path. In addition, the proposed converter features a reduced output ripple current because of the continuous current. Consequently, the proposed converter can achieve high efficiency and reduced output ripple current. To verify the performance of the proposed converter, operating principles, steady-state analyses, and experimental results from a 340 to 24-V, 100-W prototype are presented. © 2017 IEEE.","Continuous conduction mode; flyback converter; soft switching; synchronous rectifier (SR); zero-voltage switching (ZVS)","DC-DC converters; Diodes; Electric inverters; Electric rectifiers; Power converters; Switching; Continuous conduction mode; Flyback converters; High-efficiency; Leakage inductance; Operating principles; Self driven synchronous rectifiers; Steady-state analysis; Synchronous rectifier; Zero voltage switching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018980830

The 0.05 wt% C steels consisted mainly of polygonal ferrite (PF), whereas the 0.08 wt% C steels consisted of acicular ferrite (AF). The volume fraction of AF increased with increasing C content because C is an austenite stabilizer element. The volume fractions of bainitic ferrite (BF) of the 0.15 wt% Si steels were higher than those of the 0.25 wt% Si steels, whereas the volume fractions of the secondary phases were lower. From the tensile properties before and after the aging process of the strainbased API X60 pipeline steels, the yield strength increased and the uniform and total elongation decreased, which is the strain aging effect. The strain aging effect in the strain-based API X60 pipeline steels was minimized when the volume fraction of AF was increased and secondary phases were distributed uniformly. On the other hand, an excessively high C content formed fine precipitates, and the strain aging effect occurred because of the interactions among dislocations and fine precipitates. © 2017, The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","dislocation; metals; strain aging; tensile test; yield phenomena",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018834552

In this study, the anti-inflammatory potential of ginger extract was assessed in a cellular model of gut inflammation. In addition, the effects of ginger extract and its major active compounds on intestinal barrier function were evaluated. The response of Caco-2 cells following exposure to a mixture of inflammatory mediators [interleukin [IL]-1β, 25 ng/mL; lipopolysaccharides [LPS], 10 ng/mL; tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, 50 ng/mL; and interferon [INF]-γ, 50 ng/mL] were assessed by measuring the levels of secreted IL-6 and IL-8. In addition, the mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were measured. Moreover, the degree of nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibition was examined, and the intestinal barrier function was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran transfer. It was observed that ginger extract and its constituents improved inflammatory responses by decreasing the levels of nitrite, PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 via NF-κB inhibition.

However, on condition that minimum numbers of microphone are used, it is difficult to acquire accurate audio signal for rendering audio data to the image with the choice of view point. Especially, degradation of high frequency components (HFC) happens due to the characteristic of polar pattern for microphone. The degradation of HFC causes imperfection of signal restoration and leads to the degradation of clarity for hearing. In this paper, a compensation method for the degradation of HFC audio signal is proposed for producing an immersive audio effect at realistic media. Our experimental results show that low frequency components (LFC) of audio signal had a little directional degradation in spite of effect of the polar patterns of microphone and the compensation of HFC can be realized with adapting the attenuation inclination of LFC.

In this brief, we consider to enlarge the representational capacity of CRF via mixture modeling. The motivation is that a single CRF can perform well if the data conform to the statistical dependence assumption imposed by the CRF model structure, whereas it may potentially fail to model the data that come from multiple different sources or domains. For the conventional conditional likelihood objective, we derive the expectation-maximization algorithm in conjunction with the direct gradient ascent method for learning a CRF mixture with sequence or image-structured data. In addition, we provide alternative mixture learning algorithms that aim to maximize either the classification margin or the sitewise conditional likelihood, which were previously shown to outperform the conventional estimator for single CRF models in a variety of situations. We demonstrate the improved prediction accuracy of the proposed mixture learning algorithms on several important sequence labeling problems. © 2016 IEEE.","Conditional random fields (CRFs); Discriminative learning; Mixture models; Structured output prediction","Algorithms; Algorithms; Forecasting; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Image segmentation; Maximum principle; Maximum principle; Mixtures; Mixtures; Random processes; Random processes; Classification margins; Classification margins; Conditional likelihood; Conditional likelihood; Conditional random field; Conditional random field; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Prediction accuracy; Probabilistic modeling; Probabilistic modeling; Statistical dependence; Statistical dependence; Structured output prediction; Structured output prediction; Learning algorithms; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959159255

To address this challenge, we propose a green cloud infrastructure which provides security and efficiency based on energy harvesting (EH-GC). The EH-GC is basically focused on harvesting the heat energy produced by data centers in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) infrastructure. A pyroelectric material is used to generate the electric current from heat using the Olsen cycle. In order to achieve efficient green cloud computing, the architecture utilizes a genetic algorithm for proper virtual machine allocation, taking into consideration less Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. The architecture utilizes Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) correlation analysis based on a triangular map area generation to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in the data center layer of the IaaS. Finally, the experimental analysis is explained based on the energy parameter, which proves that our model is efficient and secure, and that it efficiently reuses the energy emitted from the data center. © 2017 by the authors.","Energy harvesting; Green cloud computing; Olsen cycle; Pyroelectric","analytical method; electricity; energy efficiency; energy use; experimental study; genetic algorithm; infrastructure; power generation; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018385464

To mitigate the response effect in eliciting the WTP and to increase the statistical efficiency of the analysis of the WTP data, we employed a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question format. Furthermore, we used a spike model to model the WTP responses with zero observations.

These two groups differ in terms of when they adopt high-tech products and how they feel about accepting technology. Among others, the fundamental discrepancies in technology readiness between respective groups are of paramount importance in analysing customer requirements. However, few studies consider this customer heterogeneity with respect to technology readiness when classifying and prioritising customer requirements. This paper suggests an extended Kano approach which integrates customers' disparate technology readiness. First, customers are classified into innovative and pragmatic groups using a Technology Readiness Index as a measure. Second, a new integrated Kano matrix is introduced, in which two groups become the column and row values, and which allows four new types of customer requirements to be defined, based on the differences between the two groups. For each category, we specify the relationship between the distinctive features of that category and customer satisfaction. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","customer requirements; Kano model; technology readiness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945408750

It is also used in many industrial fields owing to its property of transmitting light. In particular, because of the recent developments in electronics, the industrial demand for a process for generating conductive circuit patterns on glass surfaces is increasing rapidly. Circuit patterns on glass are mainly by a special non-contact processing method using a laser beam or a chemical methods. However this method has disadvantages such as low conductivity, high cost and limitation on the size of the material. To solve this problem, processes such as LCLD have been widely studied. However they have disadvantages such as slow speed and limitation on the materials. Therefore, in this study, generation of circuit pattern was tried using the LIBWE process, which is capable of machining the glass regardless of the characteristics of the glass with a relatively simple equipment configuration. In particular, processing of glass was done to create a rough surface and form a seed layer for electroless deposition using a general-purpose laser beam having a wavelength of 1064 nm. Through this method, it is possible to achieve good productivity, and produce conductive and adhesive circuit patterns by a simple process than by traditional processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conductive patterning; Electroless deposition; Glass; Laser-induced backside wet etching (LIBWE); Metal seed layer","Deposition; Electroless plating; Fused silica; Laser beams; Processing; Timing circuits; Circuit patterning; Conductive patterning; Equipment configuration; Industrial demands; Industrial fields; Laser-induced backside wet etchings; Metal seeds; Transparent material; Glass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014367586

Although homogenization increased the initial BCAA solubility, irrespective of pH (pH 3 or 6), homogenization alone was not sufficient to increase their long-term solubility. The incorporation of stabilizers into nanosuspensions increased the saturation concentration of BCAAs but the effect of stabilizers on the increase in the saturation concentration of BCAAs was more pronounced at pH 6.0. At pH 6, Tween 80 dramatically increased the colloidal stability of the BCAA nanosuspensions, independent of the BCAA:stabilizer ratio but not at pH 3. However, the effect of lysolecithin on the colloidal stability of nanosuspended BCAAs varied depending on pH and BCAA:lysolecithin ratio. In lysolecithin-related nanosuspensions, there was no clear relationship between the colloidal stability and nanosuspension conditions including pH and BCAA:lysolecithin ratio.

However, efforts to obtain ultrafast cycling stability in carbon and metal oxide composites at high current density for practical applications still face important challenges because of the longer Li-ion diffusion pathway, which leads to poor ultrafast performance during cycling. Here, tunneled mesoporous carbon nanofibers with embedded ZnO nanoparticles (TMCNF/ZnO) are synthesized by electrospinning, carbonization, and postcalcination. The optimized TMCNF/ZnO shows improved electrochemical performance, delivering outstanding ultrafast cycling stability, indicating a higher specific capacity than previously reported ZnO-based anode materials in LIBs.

Although hyperlenses, super-resolution imaging devices based on highly anisotropic dispersion relations that allow the access of high-wavevector components, have recently achieved far-field sub-diffraction imaging in real-time, the previously demonstrated devices have suffered from the extreme difficulties of both the fabrication process and the non-artificial objects placement. This results in restrictions on the practical applications of the hyperlens devices. While implementing large-scale hyperlens arrays in conventional microscopy is desirable to solve such issues, it has not been feasible to fabricate such large-scale hyperlens array with the previously used nanofabrication methods. Here, we suggest a scalable and reliable fabrication process of a large-scale hyperlens device based on direct pattern transfer techniques. We fabricate a 5 cm × 5 cm size hyperlenses array and experimentally demonstrate that it can resolve sub-diffraction features down to 160 nm under 410 nm wavelength visible light. The array-based hyperlens device will provide a simple solution for much more practical far-field and real-time super-resolution imaging which can be widely used in optics, biology, medical science, nanotechnology and other closely related interdisciplinary fields. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"biology; diffraction; imaging; medicine; microscopy; nanofabrication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017371541

The LVDT produces the displacement of the rail gauge and vibration when point moving or a train passes on turnout systems and the accelerometer produces impact forces induced by wheel sets. We performed data extraction from the measured signals and parameterized the extracted signals into meaningful quantities. The parameters are used for classifying whether the turnout status is normal.

The influence of the grinding effect was evaluated using a previous empirical prediction model for dynamic wheel-rail forces; model includes first-order derivatives of QI (Quality Index) and vehicle velocity. The theoretical dynamic wheel-rail force determined using the previous prediction equation was analyzed using the QI, which decreased due to rail grinding as determined through field measurements. At a constant track support stiffness, an increase in the QI caused an increase in dynamic wheel-rail forces. Further, it can be inferred that the results of dynamic wheel-rail analysis obtained using the measured data, such as the variation of QI due to rail grinding, can be used to predict the peak dynamic forces. Therefore, it is obvious that the optimum amount of rail grinding can be determined by considering the QI, that was regarding an operation characteristics of the target track (vehicle velocity and wheel load). © 2017 The Korean Society for Railway.

In a serrated bolt, a serrated shape is formed on the bottom surface of the bolt head to create an obstacle to releasing. In this study, finite element analyses for the joining and releasing of bolts were carried out, and the anti-releasing performance was predicted. Based on the results of analyses using various numbers of serrations and fastening depths, the effects of the number of serrations and fastening depth on the anti-releasing performance were investigated.","Release torque; Releasing analysis; Serration bolt","Finite element method; Joining; Torque; Bottom surfaces; Release torque; Releasing analysis; Bolts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027877451

In practice, the frequency and phase of velocity ripples always change minutely, which makes it impossible to compensate for the ripple by simply inserting an opposite feed-forward signal in the system. In this study, an active-phase compensation algorithm was developed to enable the velocity-ripple controller to track the phase change of the ripples in real time. The proposed controller can compensate for the velocity ripple whatever its cause, including disturbance by the torque ripple. The algorithm consists of three functional modules: the velocity-ripple extractor, the synchronized integrator, and the phase shifter. Experimental results showed that the proposed controller clearly reduces velocity ripples with phase variation.

Six kinds of lowcarbon steel specimens were fabricated by adding micro-alloying elements of Nb, Ti and V, and by varying isothermal transformation temperature. Ferrite grain size of the specimens containing mirco-alloying elements was smaller than that of the Base specimens because of pinning effect by the precipitates of carbonitrides at austenite grain boundaries. The pearlite interlamellar spacing and cementite thickness decreased with decreasing transformation temperature, while the pearlite volume fraction was hardly affected by micro-alloying elements and transformation temperature. The room-temperature tensile test results showed that the yield strength increased mostly with decreasing ferrite grain size and elongation was slightly improved as the ferrite grain size and pearlite interlamellar spacing decreased. All the specimens exhibited a discontinuous yielding behavior and the yield point elongation of the Nb4 and TiNbV specimens containing micro-alloying elements was larger than that of the Base specimens, presumably due to repetitive pinning and release of dislocation by the fine precipitates of carbonitrides. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Low-carbon steels; Micro-alloying elements; Tensile properties; Transformation temperature; Yield point elongation","Alloying; Alloying elements; Carbides; Carbon nitride; Elongation; Ferrite; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Microalloying; Microstructure; Pearlite; Pearlitic transformations; Steel research; Tensile properties; Tensile testing; Titanium; Austenite grain boundaries; Discontinuous yielding; Ferrite grain size; Isothermal transformations; Micro-alloying elements; Pearlite interlamellar spacing; Transformation temperatures; Yield point elongations; Low carbon steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018271261

However, CNF still faces important challenges due to the low mesopore volume, leading to a poor high-rate performance. In the present study, we prepared the unique architecture of the activated mesoporous CNF with a high specific surface area and high mesopore volume, which were successfully synthesized using PMMA as a pore-forming agent and the KOH activation. The activated mesoporous CNF was found to exhibit the high specific surface area of 703 m2 g-1 , total pore volume of 0.51 cm3 g-1 , average pore diameter of 2.9 nm, and high mesopore volume of 35.2 %. The activated mesoporous CNF also indicated the high specific capacitance of 143 F g-1 , high-rate performance, high energy density of 17.9-13.0Wh kg-1 , and excellent cycling stability.

The optimal TH structure is explored by systematically investigating the heating and transmittance characteristics depending on the metal material, thickness, and micromesh dimension. The transmittance is further enhanced by incorporating the biomimetic moth-eye anti-reflection layer (ARC) which effectively reduces the reflection along with diffraction and scattering of incident light. The fabricated ARC-integrated TH exhibits an excellent transmittance with satisfactory heating up to 47.5oC at the applied current of 0.6 A, which demonstrates ten times more power-efficient than conventional macroscale wire defrosters used in most vehicles. Successful defrosting of both planar and curved large-area surfaces is visually demonstrated by attaching the 70 × 70 mm-sized THs fabricated on a glass or flexible polymer. This versatile, highthroughput TH architecturing may be applicable to many other devices requiring flexibility, scalability, and power-efficient operation, and their commercially-feasible production. © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Anti-reflection; Continuous process; Flexible heater; Roll photolithography; Transparent heater","Automobile manufacture; Biomimetics; Structural optimization; Substrates; Anti reflection; Anti-reflection layers; Continuous process; Diffraction and scattering; Flexible heaters; Flexible polymers; Flexible substrate; Transparent heater; Fabrication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017294109

In addition, the pattern is modified online through the use of ground contact information from the six feet.

In turn, GOx moiety was further immobilized on the [BQ/PEI]/CNT to form GOx/[BQ/PEI]/CNT catalyst. This catalyst has a special advantage in that the BQ that has been usually dissolved into electrolyte was immobilized on supporter. According to the electrochemical analysis, maximum current density of the GOx/[BQ/PEI]/CNT catalyst was 1.9 fold better than that of the catalyst that did not entrap BQ with the value of 34.16 μA/cm2, verifying that catalytic activity of the catalyst was enhanced by adoption of BQ.

To suppress Ge segregation to obtain the interface sharpness between silicon layers and silicon/germanium composite layers, approaches have used silicon hydride gas species. The hydrogen atoms can play a role of inhibitors of silicon/germanium exchange. However, there are few kinetic models to explain the hydrogen effects. We propose using segregation probability which is affected by hydrogen atoms covering substrate surfaces.

However, previous research on the scenario-based roadmap has commonly employed a single methodology to develop technology roadmaps, even if the characteristics of layers in technology roadmaps are different. The market planning deals with ‘external scenarios’ which are uncontrollable, whereas the product and technology planning is associated with ‘internal scenarios’ which are controllable. The former is related to the analysis and evaluation, whereas the latter is associated with strategic decision-making. This leads to the important implication that we have to consider two different perspectives of planning and have to utilize two different methodologies. In response, this paper employs an approach using cross impact analysis (CIA) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) as a tool for scenario-based roadmapping. CIA is employed for roadmapping the market layer due to its ability to measure the impact of the external environment, whereas AHP is employed to roadmap the technology and product layers, due to its characteristics of decision-making process.

This is due to the fact that the translational symmetry strongly governs the transport properties of every form of wave. Although quasiperiodic structures with or without disorder have been studied, a clear mechanism for wave transport in three-dimensional quasicrystals including localization is missing. To study the intrinsic quasiperiodic effects on wave transport, the time invariance of the lattice structure and the loss-free condition must be controlled. Here, using finite-difference methods, we study the diffusive-like transport and localization of photonic waves in a three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystal without additional disorder.

Therefore, this study aimed to ascertain the individual existence of RDS and SDS using amylosucrase-modified starch. Enzymatic hydrolysis curves of modified waxy corn starches were obtained and fitted to a logarithm of slope (LOS) plot. LOS plots for amylosucrase-modified starches revealed a discontinuity, reflecting the change of rate constant k during digestion, such that distinguishable k s for each of the phases were defined (kRDS, kSDS). The LOS plot approach could be utilized as a persuasive basis for the classification of the starch fractions. The structure of amylosucrase-modified starches was characterized before and after removal of RDS and/or SDS. Branch chains with certain lengths contributed to the organization of each fraction and determined the primary crystallite configuration of amylosucrase-modified starches causing the diversity of digestion properties. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Amylosucrase; Branch chain length distribution; In vitro digestion; Log of slope plot; Slowly digestible starch",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007130725

The detection limits (0.27 μM and 0.32 μM) for Fe3+ and Fe2+ were much lower than the environmental protection agency guideline (5.37 μM) in drinking water. The sensor could be used to quantify Fe3+ in real water samples. Moreover, this sensor acted as a ‘turn-on’ and ‘turn-off’ type fluorescent sensor toward Al3+ and pyrophosphate. The sensing mechanism of the sensor for Al3+ could be explained by chelation-enhanced fluorescence effect, which was supported by theoretical calculations. Through a metal-complex displacement method, the sensor-Al3+ complex selectively responded to pyrophosphate over various anions especially including phosphate-based anions.

In this study, we investigated the effects of licoricidin on photoaging of UVA-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Methods: In vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity, cellular protective effect and inhibition of elastase activity was determined by Fe3+-EDTA/H2O2 systems, photohaemolysis and elastase activity assay, respectively. Anti-oxidative capacity of the compound was evaluated by fluorescent ELISA and 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCF-DA) assay. The expression of protein and phosphorylation was examined using Western blot. Results: The ROS scavenging activity (OSC50) of licoricidin was 2.77 μM. It was 3.1-fold higher than that of L-ascorbic acid. Its protective effects were confirmed in a study of 1O2-induced cellular damage to human erythrocytes. The τ50 value of 10 μM of licoricidin was 71.0 min; this was markedly higher than that obtained with α-tocopherol (37.0 min). The elastase inhibitory activity of licoricidin (IC50 of 61.2 μM) was 2.1-fold more potent than that of oleanolic acid. Licoricidin markedly reduced the UVA-induced intracellular ROS in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot revealed that licoricidin attenuated the UVA-dependent induction of MMP-1 protein. Mechanistically, this appeared to be due to licoricidin-dependent inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) phosphorylation, which resulted in decreased c-Jun activation and reduced c-Jun and c-Fos expression. Conclusion: Licoricidin blocks UVA-induced photoaging via ROS scavenging. This activity converges to limit the activity of MMP-1. These data suggest that licoricidin may be considered as an active ingredient in new topically applied anti-ageing formulations. © 2016 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie","activator protein 1; licoricidin; matrix metalloproteinases; mitogen-activated protein kinases; reactive oxygen species; ultraviolet A","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; edetic acid; elastase; ferric ion; hydrogen peroxide; interstitial collagenase; isoflavonoid; licoricidin; mitogen activated protein kinase; oleanolic acid; protein c fos; protein c jun; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; benzopyran derivative; interstitial collagenase; licoricidin; mitogen activated protein kinase; antioxidant activity; Article; cell damage; cell protection; cell viability; controlled study; drug analysis; drug mechanism; drug structure; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme phosphorylation; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; hemolysis; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; photoaging; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; skin fibroblast; ultraviolet A radiation; Western blotting; biosynthesis; chemistry; cutaneous parameters; cytology; drug effects; enzyme activation; enzyme induction; fibroblast; isolation and purification; metabolism; radiation response; signal transduction; skin; ultraviolet radiation; Benzopyrans; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Induction; Fibroblasts; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; Humans; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Skin; Skin Aging; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987602206

Based on this, it was determined that acid treatment was effective in improving the quality of recycled fine aggregates. In addition, the results of reviewing the strength characteristics of the mortar obtained using the acid-treated aggregates showed that the residue substances remaining in the recycled fine aggregates after reacting with the cement paste had a negative impact on the concrete strength.

In addition, optimal parameters of the continuous process were also studied by experimentally comparing the resultant shape of the microstencil depending on the process speed, aspect ratio of the mold, and applied pressure. As a result, the polymeric microstencil was produced continuously in very high yields, and its maximum resolution reached 20 μm in diameter. For an easy, continuous demolding during the roll-to-roll process, the material chosen for the substrate film was paraffin-coated film, which has the surface energy low enough for dewetting while having a higher adhesion value than polydimethylsiloxane mold.

Enhancing security in the home environment has been recognized as one of the main obstacles to realizing the vision of creating energy-efficient smart homes and buildings. Understanding the risks associated with the use and potential exploitation of information about homes, end-users, and partners, as well as forming techniques for integrating security assessments into the design, is not straightforward. To address this challenge, we propose enhanced secure network architecture (SH-SecNet) for the diagnosis of security threats in the smart home. In our architecture, we use the Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) technique to analyze the network flow packet in the network layer, as this classifies the network traffic by extracting the correlation between network traffic features. We evaluated the performance of our architecture with respect to various parameters, such as CPU utilization, throughput, round trip time, and accuracy. The result of the evaluation shows that our architecture is efficient and accurate in detecting and mitigating attacks in the smart home network with a low performance overhead. © 2017 by the authors.","Internet-of-Things; Multivariate Correlation Analysis; Security; Smart home; Threat diagnosis","architecture; correlation; detection method; energy efficiency; Internet; multivariate analysis; network design; performance assessment; security threat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017346465

The formation of α-FeOOH was confirmed by observing α-Fe2O3 under the hydrothermal condition. The results of the experiment indicate that the activated carbon powder functioned effectively as the support material of the composite, providing a large active site on the surface of the composite, preventing the agglomeration of precipitate particles of FeOOH, and then allowing high breakthrough capacity (0.171 g H2S/g composite) compared to that of α-FeOOH alone (0.046 g H2S/g α-FeOOH). The textural analyses showed that the composite of the α-FeOOH and activated carbon powder had a mesoporous structure with a BET surface area of 500 m2/g, while the surface area was 188 m2/g for α-FeOOH alone.

Here, we performed a prototype study to identify metabolites that predict responses to an intervention against oxidative stress and inflammation, using a data set from a randomized controlled trial evaluating Korean black raspberry (KBR) in sedentary overweight/obese subjects. First, a linear mixed-effects model analysis with multiple testing correction showed that four-week consumption of KBR significantly changed oxidized glutathione (GSSG, q = 0.027) level, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to GSSG (q = 0.039) in erythrocytes, malondialdehyde (MDA, q = 0.006) and interleukin-6 (q = 0.006) levels in plasma, and seventeen NMR metabolites in urine compared with those in the placebo group. A subsequent generalized linear mixed model analysis showed linear correlations between baseline urinary glycine and N-phenylacetylglycine (PAG) and changes in the GSH:GSSG ratio (p = 0.008 and 0.004) as well as between baseline urinary adenine and changes in MDA (p = 0.018). Then, receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that a two-metabolite set (glycine and PAG) had the strongest prognostic relevance for future interventions against oxidative stress (the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.778). Leave-one-out cross-validation confirmed the accuracy of prediction (AUC = 0.683). The current findings suggest that a higher level of this two-metabolite set at baseline is useful for predicting responders to dietary interventions in subjects with oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to the emergence of personalized nutrition. © 2017 by the authors.

This nonheme NiII complex 1 catalyzed the epoxidation reaction of a wide range of olefins with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) under mild conditions.

Moreover, the nature of solvent significantly influenced partitioning between heterolytic and homolytic O−O bond cleavage of the Ni–acylperoxo intermediate (2). The O−O bond of 2 proceeded predominantly through heterolytic cleavage in a protic solvent, such as CH3OH.

B. antarctica is an extremophile with unusual adaptations. The larvae of B. antarctica are desiccation- and freeze-tolerant and the adults are wingless. Recently, the compact genome of B. antarctica was reported and it is the first Antarctic eukaryote to be sequenced. Although P. steinenii occurs naturally in the Antarctic with B. antarctica, the larvae of P. steinenii are cold-tolerant but not freeze-tolerant and the adults are winged. Differences in adaptations in the Antarctic midges are interesting in terms of evolutionary processes within an extreme environment. Herein, we provide the genome of another Antarctic midge to help elucidate the evolution of these species. Results: The draft genome of P. steinenii had a total size of 138 Mbp, comprising 9513 contigs with an N50 contig size of 34,110 bp, and a GC content of 32.2%. Overall, 13,468 genes were predicted using the MAKER annotation pipeline, and gene ontology classified 10,801 (80.2%) predicted genes to a function. Compared with the assembled genome architecture of B. antarctica, that of P. steinenii was approximately 50 Mbp longer with 6.2-fold more repeat sequences, whereas gene regions were as similarly compact as in B. antarctica.

However, they are exposed to cyclic thermal load, generally in the temperature range of-20°C to 60°C, in railways during a long-Term SHM and the cyclic thermal load can affect the mechanical strength of FBGs. In this paper, the effects of both cyclic thermal load and the reflectivity of FBGs on the mechanical strength are investigated though tension tests of FBG specimens after they are aged in a thermal chamber with temperature changes in a range from-20°C to 60°C for 300 cycles. Results from tension tests reveal that the mechanical strength of FBGs decreases about 8% as the thermal cycle increases to 100 cycles; the mechanical strength then remains steady until 300 cycles. Otherwise, the mechanical strength of FBGs with reflectivity of 6dB (70%) and 10dB (90%) exhibits degradation values of about 6% and 12%, respectively, compared to that with reflectivity of 3dB (50%) at 300 cycles. SEM photos of the Bragg grating parts also show defects that cause their strength degradation. Consequently, it should be considered that mechanical strength of FBGs can be degraded by both thermal cycles and the reflectivity if the FBGs are exposed to repetitive thermal load during a long-Term SHM. © Copyright 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd.","Fiber Bragg grating; Mechanical strength; Structural health monitoring; Thermal load","Fiber Bragg gratings; Reflection; Strength of materials; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Thermal cycling; Thermal load; Absolute measurements; Cyclic thermal loads; Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors; Strength degradation; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Temperature changes; Temperature range; Thermal chamber; Structural health monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018507792

In order to optimize their transparent conducting performance, ITO nanoinks were composed of ITO nanoparticles alone and the weight ratios of the nanorods to nanoparticles in the ITO nanoinks were adjusted to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5. As a result, compared to the other TCOs, the ITO TCOs formed by the ITO nanoinks with weight ratio of 0.1 were found to exhibit outstanding transparent conducting performance in terms of sheet resistance (~102.3 Q/square) and optical transmittance (~80.2 %) at 550 nm; these excellent properties are due to the enhanced Hall mobility induced by the interconnection of the composite nanorods with the (440) planes of the short lattice distance in the TCOs, in which the presence of the nanorods can serve as a conducting pathway for electrons. Therefore, this resulting material can be proposed as a potential candidate for solution-based TCOs for use in optoelectronic devices requiring large-scale and low-cost processes. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Low annealing temperature; Nanoinks; Nanorods; Sn-doped in2O3; Solution-based transparent conducting oxides","Hall mobility; Nanoparticles; Optical lattices; Optoelectronic devices; Temperature; Tin; Annealing temperatures; Composite nano rods; Conducting performance; Low temperature performance; Nanoinks; Resulting materials; Sn-doped in; Transparent conducting oxide; Nanorods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016305432

We define three key designs of such hydrogel devices, having linear, T-shaped, and branched channels and report results of numerical simulation of the process of their infusion with solute carried by the incoming fluid. The computational procedure takes into account both pressure-driven convection and concentration gradient-driven diffusion in the permeable gel matrix. We define the criteria for evaluation of the fluid infusion rate, uniformity, solute loss by outflow and overall performance. The T-shaped channel network was identified as the most efficient one and was improved further by investigating the effect of the channel-end secondary branches.

For the diagnosis and treatment, clinicians use the self-report information, but the report data often does not match actual usage pattern. The paper examines the similarity and variance in smartphone usage patterns between the measured data and self-reported data. Methods Together with the self-reported data, the real usage log data is collected from 35 college students in a metropolitan region of Northeast Asia, using Android smartphone monitoring application developed by the authors. Results The unconscious users underestimate their usage time by 40%, in spite of 15% more use in the actual usage. Messengers are most-used application regardless of their self-report, and significant preference to SNS applications was observed in addict group. The actual hourly pattern is consistent with the reported one. College students use more in the afternoon, when they have more free time and cannot use PCs. No significant difference in hourly pattern is observed between the measured and self-report. Conclusion The result shows there are significant cognitive bias in actual usage patterns exists in self report of smartphone addictions.

In the online procedure of the proposed FCS-MPC, the optimal voltage vector and its corresponding optimal modulation factor are determined based on the principle of torque and rotor flux error minimization. In this method, a reference state is determined in a systematic way so that the reference torque tracking with maximum torque per ampere and flux-limited operation could be achieved. In addition, a weighting matrix for the state tracking error is optimized in offline using the linear matrix inequality based optimization problem. The efficacy of the proposed FCS-MPC method is proved by the simulation and experimental results at different working circumstances. The comparison of the presented control system with the conventional FCS-MPC and with other reported FCS-MPC with modulation control is made.

Previous research suggests that national culture may exert an independent influence on individuals’ PSM. This article examines PSM as an individual-level variable that is related to national culture, which is represented by Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. Using data from the International Social Survey Programme (2005), I investigate the relationship between cultural dimensions and individuals’ PSM. This article demonstrates that masculinity and indulgence are positively related to individuals’ PSM, whereas individualism is negatively associated with individuals’ PSM. However, power distance and uncertainty avoidance have a non-significant relationship with PSM. This article provides partial support for the thesis that national culture is associated with individuals’ PSM, but future research is required to explicate the relationship of cultural characteristics to individuals’ PSM. Points for practitioners: Culture influences certain types of behavior both directly and indirectly. The article suggests that cultural tendencies such as masculinity, indulgence, and collectivism have a significant positive influence on individuals’ PSM. Organizational education and socialization enhancing these cultural values are likely to foster employees’ PSM. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","civil service; ethics; human resources management; personnel policies; public management","civil service; culture; ethics; human resource; research; resource management; survey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014718515

The proposed endoscope consists of a camera head, cable, camera controller, and wireless handle. The lens module with a 150° degrees AOV (Angle of View) is achieved using the plastic injection-molding process to reduce manufacturing costs. A serial CMOS image sensor using the MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) CSI-2 (Camera Serial Interface-2) interface physically separates the camera processor from the camera head. The camera head and the cable have a compact structure due to the BCC (Backend-Camera-Controller) architecture. The size of the camera head and the camera controller is 8×8×26 mm and 7×55 mm, respectively. The wireless handle supports a UWB (Ultra-Wide-Band) or a Wi-Fi communication to transmit video data. The UWB link supports a maximum data transfer rate of ~37 Mbps to transmit video data with a resolution of 1280×720 pixels at a frame rate of 30 fps in the MJPEG (Motion JPEG) format. Although the Wi-Fi link provides a lower data transfer rate (~8 Mbps Max.), it has the advantage of flexible interoperability with various mobile devices. The latency of the UWB link is measured to be ~0.1 sec. The Wi-Fi link has a larger latency (~0.5 sec) due to its lower data transfer rate.

A2E has been concerned in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: To perform this study, A2E-accumulated ARPE-19 cells were exposed to blue light to induce cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity and apoptotic gene expression levels were evaluated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and real-time PCR analysis, respectively. Key findings: Curcuma longa L. extract was found to exert a protective effect in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 15 μm, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin exerted significant protective effects against blue light-induced cytotoxicity. Treatment with CLE and curcuminoids meaningfully reduced the mRNA levels of c-Abl and p53, which was known to be augmented in apoptotic RPE cells. Demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin were found to inhibit p38 expression, which is increased in blue light-irradiated A2E-accumulated RPE cells. Conclusions: Curcuma longa L. extract and its curcuminoids provided significant protection against photooxidative damage and apoptosis in the RPE cells. Our results suggest that curcuminoids may show potential in the treatment of AMD. © 2017 Royal Pharmaceutical Society","A2E; age-related macular degeneration; apoptosis; blue light; curcumin","Abelson kinase; Curcuma longa extract; demethoxycurcumin; didemethoxycurcumin; lactate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; protein p53; messenger RNA; plant extract; adult; age related macular degeneration; apoptosis; Article; blue light; cell protection; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug structure; gene expression; human; human cell; retinal pigment epithelium; apoptosis; cell death; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; Curcuma; drug effects; epithelium cell; light; macular degeneration; metabolism; retinal pigment epithelium; Apoptosis; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Curcuma; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Light; Macular Degeneration; Plant Extracts; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; RNA, Messenger",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013311741

APTs generally use various attack techniques to gain access to the unauthorized system and then progressively spread throughout the network. The prime objectives of APT attacks are to steal intellectual property, legal documents, sensitive internal business and other data. If an attack is successfully launched on a system, the timely detection of attack is extremely important to stop APTs from further spreading and for mitigating its impact. On the other hand, internet of things (IoT) devices quickly become ubiquitous while IoT services become pervasive. Their prosperity has not gone unnoticed, and the number of attacks and threats against IoT devices and services are also increasing. Cyber-attacks are not new to IoT, but as the IoT will be deeply intertwined in our societies and lives, it becomes essential to take cyber defense seriously. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed framework architecture for the detection of APTs named as distributed framework architecture for APTs detection (DFA-AD), which is a promising basis for modern intrusion detection systems. In contrast to other approaches, the DFA-AD technique for detecting APT attack is based on multiple parallel classifiers, which classify the events in a distributed environment and event correlation among those events. Each classifier method is focused on detecting the APT’s attack technique independently. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieves greater effectiveness and accuracy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Advanced persistent threats; Classification and regression trees; Dynamic Bayesian game model; Genetic programming; Internet of things; Support vector machines","Access control; Computer crime; Crime; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Network architecture; Network security; Support vector machines; Advanced persistent threats; Bayesian game; Classification and regression tree; Detection of attacks; Distributed environments; Distributed framework; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Malware",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006802692

This paper attempts to assess the public's additional willingness to pay (WTP) for substituting consumption of a unit of electricity generated from nuclear power plant, currently a dominant power generation source in Korea, with that produced from NG-based CHP plant in terms of decentralized generation using the contingent valuation (CV) method. To this end, a CV survey of 1,000 households was implemented. The results show that the mean additional WTP for substituting nuclear power plant by NG-based CHP plant is estimated to be KRW 55.3 (USD 0.047) per kWh of electricity, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. This value amounts to 44.7% of the average price for electricity, KRW 123.69 (USD 0.106) in 2015, which implies that the public are ready to shoulder a significant financial burden to achieve the substitution. Moreover, the value can be interpreted as an external cost of nuclear power generation relative to NG-based CHP generation, or as an external benefit of NG-based CHP generation relative to nuclear power generation with a view to decentralized generation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Combined heat and power; Contingent valuation; Decentralized generation; Natural gas; Willingness to pay","Distributed power generation; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Heating; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Resource valuation; Combined heat and power; Contingent valuations; Decentralized generation; External benefits; External costs; Natural gas based; Power generation sources; Willingness to pay; Cogeneration plants; combined heat and power; contingent valuation; decentralization; natural gas; nuclear power plant; power generation; substitution; willingness to pay; Korea; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006415532

A variety of trust factors related to the behaviors of sensor nodes is measured, including the packet forwarding capacity, the repetition rate, the consistency of the packet content, the delay, the integrity, etc. To void the impact of subjective setting, each trust factor is determined by means of the information entropy theory.

For this reason, much recent research into new service development has focused on methods of identifying and generating new service ideas. The most prevalent method for generating a new service is a morphological analysis that decomposes a system into several dimensions and values, and then recombines those values to generate new services. Despite the popularity of morphological analysis, how to build morphological matrix has been an area of subjective expert judgment. In this paper, we focused on the possibility to utilize the big data to the morphological analysis to address the subjective morphological building process, by suggesting a case-based morphological analysis. By employing case-based reasoning and network analysis, firms can easily identify direct and indirect clues for the new services and integrate these results to the morphological building processes.

The plasma treated pattern shows a fully densified microstructure with a resistivity of 3.23 μΩ cm, while the thermally treated pattern shows a relatively poor microstructure and high resistivity. In addition, the hydrogen plasma-treated copper pattern retains its electrical resistivity for one month without any significant decrease.

According to the measurements of the current density peak of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) redox reaction, electron transfer rate, Michaelis-Menten constants and sensitivity, CNT/PEI/(GOx-Cat) shows the best values, and this is attributed to the excellent catalytic activity of GOx and the H2O2 decomposition capability of the catalase.

For this purpose, the planar velocity profiles were measured from 1.75B, 1.75 times of bore position apart from the bottom of head, to 6.00B positions using particle - image velocimetry. The flow patterns were examined with both a straight and a helical port. The velocity profiles, streamlines, and centers of swirl were almost the same at the same valve lift regardless of the measuring position, which is quite different from the case of the pent-roof combustion chamber. All the eccentricity values of the straight port were out of distortion criterion 0.15 through the lifts and the position. However, the values of the helical port exceeded the distortion criterion by up to 4 mm lift, but decreased rapidly above the 3.00B position and the 5 mm lift. There always existed a relative offset effect in the evaluation of the swirl coefficient using the PIV method due to the difference of the ideal impulse swirl meter velocity profile assumption, except for the cylinder-center-base estimation that was below 4 mm of the straight port.

Through finite element (FE) analysis, the effects of two design parameters (die gap and chamfer height) on the dimensional accuracy were investigated. Three combinations of chamfer heights were chosen first and the corresponding die gap candidates selected by geometric calculation. FE analyses were performed for each combination and their results indicated that the concave chamfer height should be less than 0.3 mm, while a 10 μm difference in the die gap might cause degeneration in dimensional accuracy.

Due to the low formability of Titanium alloys, bit forming of Titanium screws is difficult by cold forging. In order to overcome this low formability of Titanium alloys, two candidate processes, i.e., multi-step forging and warm forging are introduced. First, a multi-step (two-step) forging process is investigated. The punch shape and stroke of forging during the first step is designed via various analyses. Finally, the bit formability is investigated at different forging temperatures. Analyses are carried out for two-step forging at various temperatures and the formability under these thermal conditions is compared.

The most widely used probes for TERS have metal(Au or Ag)-coated AFM tips. However, the durability of metal-coated AFM tips are limited because the coating layers can be easily worn out during the measurement. Furthermore, the Ag-coated tip is oxidized when it is exposed to air. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method of fabricating a Au tip for TERS with a Au wire by electrochemical etching. Pulse waves generated by pulse width modulation was applied to an electrochemical etching system, and it was optimized by controlling etching parameters (voltage, duty cycle, frequency and immersion depth) to achieve a smoothly etched surface with a tip radius of around 20 nm. With optimized etching parameters, a Au probe tip having a desired tip radius was successfully fabricated with a yield rate of approximately 85 %. Finally, a tuning fork-based Au probe for TERS was fabricated by attaching the Au tip to a tuning fork, and its operation was confirmed by obtaining a topographical image and Raman maps of carbon-nanotubes (CNTs). © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Electrochemical etching; Etching parameters; Gold tip; Pulse wave; Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy","Carbon nanotubes; Chemical analysis; Electrochemical etching; Fabrication; Metal coatings; Nanoprobes; Probes; Raman spectroscopy; Tuning; Voltage control; Etched surface; Etching parameters; Immersion depth; Optimized etching; Physical and chemical properties; Pulse wave; Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Topographical images; Gold metallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011655172

The proposed system is composed of asymmetric steel beams with web openings, a biaxial hollow concrete slab, and glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) plates. The shear resistance of the typical composite beams is commonly determined based on the shear strength of the steel web alone. However, for the proposed system, because the steel web has several circular openings, the concrete contribution to the shear resistance should be included in the design equation. In this paper, tests and finite-element analyses were conducted to evaluate the contribution of the shear-resisting components in the proposed system. An asymmetric steel beam with web openings, inner concrete panels, and a biaxial hollow concrete slab within the effective width for shear were considered as shear-resisting components. Each component fully resisted the applied shear force, exceeding the expected value until failure, and the design equation suggested was suitable for predicting the shear strength of the proposed system. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Biaxial hollow concrete slab; Composite beam; Composite floor; Glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) plate; Metal and composite structures; Reduced story height; Shear capacity","Composite beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Concretes; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Fire resistance; Floors; Glass; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Plate metal; Plates (structural components); Precast concrete; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Shear strength; Steel beams and girders; Steel fibers; Composite beam; Composite floor systems; Composite floors; Concrete contribution; Reduced story height; Shear capacity; Shear resistances; Structural capacities; Reinforced concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010399593

The key idea of DAC is to consider another view (different from the original features) for the same set of samples, and to exploit the statistical correlation between cluster assignments in two views. However, the existing optimization is heuristic, mainly due to the difficulty in combinatorial optimization for hard cluster assignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel DAC optimization algorithm based on a probabilistic (soft) treatment, where the proposed objective function incorporates both the goodness of clustering in each view and the correlation between two views in a more principled and theoretically sound fashion. We also propose a lower-bound maximization technique that not only admits fast per-iteration solutions but also guarantees convergence to a local optimum.

Thus, the Korean government is considering the introduction of a BE mandate in which the legal blend is 5% BE and 95% gasoline (E5) until 2020 in order to expand BE use. We should examine the public acceptability of the introduction, which incurs a rise in the fuel price. This study attempts to assess the public's willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for introducing the E5 program in Korea. To this end, a contingent valuation (CV) survey of 1000 randomly selected consumers was conducted in 2014 across the nation. We used a one-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice question in the CV survey and applied the spike model to handle the WTP data with zeros. The mean WTP, a premium for the E5 per liter, is estimated to be KRW 290 (USD 0.27), which is statistically meaningful at the 1% level. This value amounts to 15.6% of the gasoline retail price in 2014 (KRW 1856 or USD 1.70) and can be interpreted as the external benefit of BE. We can conclude that gasoline consumers in Korea are ready to pay a significant premium for the E5. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol; Contingent valuation; Premium; Public acceptability; Willingness to pay","Bioethanol; Costs; Economics; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Resource valuation; Surveys; Contingent valuations; Conventional gasoline; External benefits; Korean Government; Premium; Public acceptabilities; Renewable energies; Willingness to pay; Gasoline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996957452

The traditional distribution of power in ICT industries of mobile communication sectors has significantly changed based on relations with the new actors. Recently, the concept of a “mobile ecosystem” which embraces this environmental shift is highlighted. The traditional industries such as hardware and network-based firms and new ICT industries such as software and service-based firms grow up simultaneously creating the mobile ecosystem. In this respect, this study aims to explore ecological indexes for identifying roles of ICT industries in the mobile ecosystem. To be specific, the ecological indexes are proposed to take new roles and position of ICT industries in the perspective of ecosystem into account. For this, the inter-industry analysis, which includes the physical flows between industries, is mainly used since the ecosystem is operated by streamlining physical flows. First, the mobile ecosystem is structured by using physical input-output flows and industrial relationships. Second, to explore roles of ICT industries in the mobile ecosystem, four ecological indexes have been developed and combined based on the result of inter-industry analysis: productivity, size, spillover effect, and coverage. As a result, we identified six roles for ICT industries and their relationships: commodity, landlord, controller, keystone, facilitator, and dominator. Regarding these ecological roles and relationships in ICT industries, strategic and policy implications are also suggested to improve the health of the mobile ecosystem. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological index; ICT industry; Inter-industry analysis; Korea; Mobile ecosystem","Ecology; Liquid metal cooled reactors; Mobile telecommunication systems; Public policy; Ecological indices; ICT industries; Industrial relationship; Information and Communication Technologies; Inter-industry analysis; Korea; Mobile communications; Traditional industry; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976871503

The maximum static CA of hexadecane droplets was 159° in the parallel direction and 142° in the orthogonal direction, respectively. The results from the CAH measurements indicated that the wetting and flow on the grooved mushroom structure were anisotropic.

The FCS-MPC strategy chooses the optimal output voltage vector with its optimal modulation interval. In CCS-MPC strategy, a current/torque control structure that utilizes the advantage of the dead-beat controller and combines it with a reference current prediction is presented. Then, we compare the performance of the two approaches. The comparison is mainly handled from two sides: (1) ripples reduction of torque and current waves which is assessed at steady-state, (2) fast response of torque at transient times. For a neutral comparison, both techniques are implemented to the same PMSM at the same operational circumstances. The performances of both MPC structures are found out by simulation results. As a result, torque and current ripples are reduced by CCS; whereas the FCS presents somewhat faster torque response. © 2016 IEEE.","dead-beat control; EV; finite control set; model predictive control; modulation optimization; PMSM; torque control","Modulation; Permanent magnets; Predictive control systems; Synchronous motors; Torque; Torque control; Comparative studies; Continuous control; Deadbeat control; Finite control set; Modulation optimization; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; PMSM; Reference currents; Model predictive control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015257021

The flexible composite structure was fabricated by hydrothermal growth of ZnO NRs on an electrochemically etched Si MP array with various lengths followed by mechanically delaminating the Si MP arrays from the Si substrate after embedding them in a polydimethylsiloxane matrix. Because the Si MP arrays act as a supporter to connect the ZnO NRs electrically and mechanically, verified by capacitance measurement, the output voltage from the flexible PNGs increased systematically with the increased density ZnO NRs depending on the length of the Si MPs. The flexible PNGs showed 3.2 times higher output voltage with a small change in current with increasing Si MP length from 5 to 20 μm.

While it was initially invented for detecting sources in a far field, a recent development by Kowash has shown the feasibility of the RMC for detecting mid-range sources. However, their image reconstruction algorithm often produces spurious source estimates in pixels where no source exists. In this paper, we propose to improve the RMC image quality using a variance stabilizing transform. The transform reduces the inhomogeneous Poisson noise in the RMC data.

CA, EC and EPC of POx on CNTs were used to fabricate enzymatic electrodes for enzyme-based biosensors and biofuel cells. Improved enzyme loading of EPC resulted in 6.5 and 4.5 times higher activity per weight of CNTs than those of CA and EC, respectively. After 34 days at room temperature, EPC retained 65% of initial activity, while CA and EC maintained 9.2% and 26% of their initial activities, respectively. These results indicate that precipitation and crosslinking steps of EPC have an important role in maintaining enzyme activity. To demonstrate the feasibility of POx-based biosensors and biofuel cells, the enzyme electrodes were prepared using CA, EC, and EPC samples. In the case of biosensor, the sensitivities of the CA, EC, and EPC electrodes without BQ were measured to be 0.27, 0.76 and 3.7 mA/M/cm2, while CA, EC and EPC electrode with BQ showed 25, 25, and 60 mA/M/cm2 of sensitivities, respectively. The maximum power densities of biofuel cells using CA, EC and EPC electrodes without BQ were 41, 47 and 53 µW/cm2, while CA, EC and EPC electrodes with BQ showed 260, 330 and 500 µW/cm2, respectively.

Specifically, we investigated the hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects of hederagenin, as well as the role of AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in ethanol-induced liver injury. Experimental animals were randomly divided into three groups: normal (sham), 25% ethanol, and 25% ethanol + hederagenin (50 mg/kg/day). Each group was orally administered the respective treatments once per day for 21 days. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 mRNA expression was higher and alcohol dehydrogenase mRNA expression was lower in the ethanol + hederagenin group than those in the ethanol group. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and cyclooxygenase-2, significantly increased in the ethanol group, but these increases were attenuated by hederagenin. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed increased expression of the apoptosis-associated protein, Bcl-2, and decreased expression of Bax and p53 after treatment with hederagenin. Hederagenin treatment attenuated ethanol-induced increases in activated p38 MAPK and increased the levels of phosphorylated AKT and ERK. Hederagenin alleviated ethanol-induced liver damage through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. These results suggest that hederagenin is a potential candidate for preventing alcoholic liver injury. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Alcohol; ALDH2; Apoptosis; Hederagenin; Inflammatory; Liver disease","cyclooxygenase 2; hederagenin; interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; nitric oxide; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p53; triterpenoid; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; alanine aminotransferase; alcohol; alcohol dehydrogenase; aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2; Aldh2 protein, rat; antiinflammatory agent; aspartate aminotransferase; Bax protein, rat; cholesterol; cyclooxygenase 2; hederagenin; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; oleanolic acid; protein Bax; protein p53; Ptgs2 protein, rat; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; alcohol liver disease; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; histology; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver injury; liver protection; male; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; thin layer chromatography; toxic hepatitis; Western blotting; analogs and derivatives; animal; apoptosis; blood; dietary supplement; drug effects; genetics; inflammation; liver; Liver Diseases; metabolism; phosphorylation; Wistar rat; Alanine Transaminase; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Apoptosis; Aspartate Aminotransferases; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Cholesterol; Cyclooxygenase 2; Dietary Supplements; Ethanol; Inflammation; Interleukin-6; Liver; Liver Diseases; Male; Oleanolic Acid; Phosphorylation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Triglycerides; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010304684

Chalcogenide thin films of two types, composed of Bi2Te3(monomorphic-type) and Bi2Te3—Sb2Te3(four-leg PN junction-type), were prepared by electrochemical deposition. The Pt/Al2O3powder, which acts as a heating catalyst, was synthesized by impregnation of an Al2O3powder with an aqueous solution of platinum (IV) chloride pentahydrate. Its heating process was optimized via a hydrogen-sensing evaluation to control the size of the Pt particles. The monomorphic-type TCH sensor showed an output signal of 14.2 μV in response to 10 vol% hydrogen gas, whereas an output signal of 39.6 μV was obtained from a four-leg PN junction–type TCH sensor. Even though the n–p junction-type had the same deposition area as that of the monomorphic-type, the output signal of the n–p junction TCH sensor was greater by a factor of 2.8. In addition, the monomorphic-type TCH sensor had an inferior response time (T90) of 31 s and a longer recovery time (D10) of 38 s; the four-leg PN junction-type TCH sensor had a lowest response time of 27 s and a fastest recovery time of 9 s (in 3% H2/air at room temperature). © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Chalcogenide thin film; Pt/Al2O3catalyst; Recovery time; Reliability; Response time; Thermochemical hydrogen sensor","Aluminum compounds; Antimony compounds; Bismuth compounds; Chalcogenides; Chlorine compounds; Cost effectiveness; Electrochemical deposition; Fabrication; Hydrogen; Recovery; Reduction; Reliability; Response time (computer systems); Thin films; Chalcogenide thin films; Cost-effective fabrication; Deposition areas; Fabrication and characterizations; Hydrogen-sensing; Laminated structures; Recovery time; Thermochemical hydrogens; Platinum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006979652

In this respect, different nanostructures of FeCo2O4 are designed by simply tuning the reaction temperature in hydrothermal synthesis. These nanostructures are directly grown on flexible stainless steel mesh and further applied as binder-free electrodes for SCs. The systematic study is carried out to confirm the relation between surface characteristics and electrochemical properties of FeCo2O4 thin film. Among different nanostructures, FeCo2O4 nanowire arrays exhibit hierarchical mesoporous structure and demonstrate good surface properties including high surface area and appropriate pore volume. As a consequence, relatively high specific capacitance of 1963 F g− 1 is obtained for the FeCo2O4 nanowire electrode. Further, asymmetric SC is fabricated using nanowired-FeCo2O4 and nanoparticulated-MnO2 thin films as negative and positive electrodes with neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte. Impressively, the MnO2//FeCo2O4 cell could be successfully cycled in a wide voltage window of 2.0 V, which can achieve a specific capacitance of 218 F g− 1 and energy density of 43 Wh kg− 1. In addition, the SCs exhibit improved capacitance with cycling, which is attributed to opening of micro-pores occurred by frequent ion transport. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"Capacitance; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Hydrothermal synthesis; Manganese oxide; Mesh generation; Nanowires; Sodium sulfate; Stainless steel; Supercapacitor; Thin films; Asymmetric supercapacitor; High specific capacitances; Mesoporous structures; Nanowire electrodes; Reaction temperature; Specific capacitance; Stainless steel mesh; Surface characteristics; Iron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089469008

As a result of the actually operated creativity-personality convergence education, it was found that as there exists a part which should be educated together with an aspect of personality, there have been many cases where teachers reveal their difficulties in proceeding with actual education; hereupon, this study organized and analyzed the required supplementary parts of educational contents, and the components which teachers should recognize through the actual interview survey. Accordingly, this study conducted the 6-week pre-service teacher training session about Creativity-Personality H-STAEM Convergence Education from June 17 until July 15, 2017, through which this study extracted and analyzed the cognitive components by class week and content targeting the pre-service teachers who are to conduct education of this, and the results are as follows: First, this study could put together the opinion that it’s desirable to naturally proceed with the amalgamative design class of personal aspects and creative aspects by lessening class hours for personal aspects as a theory class, and increasing class hours for object productions of creative aspects through the recognition that main class trainees are elementary & middle school students whose concentration is somewhat falling.

The triad, also known as the 3S, of tissue engineering is composed of sources (cells), scaffolds (reinforcing agents), and signaling molecules (cytokines and growth factors) and has been explored worldwide. Any of these 1176three components can be used in any combination, depending on the target tissue. It could be a source and scaffold combination, or scaffold and signal, or source and signal. 1 Many scientists have explored the alternative uses of drugs aside from their conventional medical applications. From this premise, the concept of drug repositioning has rapidly emerged not only in pharmacology but also in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

As a result, it quickly replaces hard disks in the server storage market. Parallel processing can be done in a channel level by simultaneously transmitting data through multiple channels, in a chip level by striping I/O requests to multiple chips on a page basis, in a die level by interleaving requests on multiple dies of a chip, and in a plane level by processing requests in multiple planes of a die at the same time. Although various policies have been proposed to maximize the parallel processing capability of SSDs, researches on the effect of the plane level parallel processing have not been sufficiently performed. This is because, unlike the channel level, chip level, and die level parallelism, in order to perform multi-plane operation, the types of operations must be the same, and the target pages of the planes must be located at the same position. Therefore, this study aims at verifying whether the multi-plane operation improves the overall performance of the SSD. Trace-driven simulation shows the followings. First, the wise policy that performs multi-plane operation only when the constraints of the multi-plane operation are satisfied always shows better performance than the policy that does not perform multi-plane operation. Second, the greed policy which performs the multi-plane operation with wasting clean pages even when the constraints of the multi-plane operation are not satisfied has excellent performance in the traces having the large requests. However, in the trace with a relatively small request size, its performance is lower than that of not performing multi-plane operation. © Research India Publications.","Multi-plane operation; NAND flash memory; Parallelism; SSD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050331448

A metallic target provides easy control of various film properties and chemical compositions, while a ceramic target offers structural stability and better control of stoichiometry.

Moreover, the flow fluids can leak due to sealing problems between the APT flow meter and the pipe.

The swirl number was 0.42 while the swirler angle was fixed to 37degree. For the turndown ratio, it was confirmed that the flame as a laboratory scale is stable up to 21 kW and it’s also stable even over higher thermal power. As a result, it was found that the flame height increased and the flame shape was changed from V shape to flat shape with increasing porosity of center plate. Although the flash back caused by increased porosity was suppressed, the lean flammability limit in stability map was decreased. Because the low swirl combustion has no internal recirculation zone, the middle flow pattern of the swirler had relatively uniform flow with a constant velocity across the center plate. So, as the porosity of center plate increases the heat loss of the combustor wall decrease with a reduction of the external recirculation zone which made the inner temperature conditions of combustor to increase. Consequently, the emission of NOx and CO increased with porosity increasing. © 2018 Combustion Institute.

In order to divide input of DC-DC module (dc-link capacitor), the transformer with dual-primary winding is used. Moreover, the leakage inductor currents are absorbed by the dc-link capacitors through a snubber diode and the maximum voltage stress is limited to double DC-link voltage. Therefore, there are virtually no conduction losses by snubber circuit. In additional, some input power is directly transferred to the load and the remaining power is stored in dc-link capacitor.

By considering the capacitor voltages as control variables, these control schemes can provide seamless transfer of operation modes to the inverter even at the event of unintentional islanding. However, since these schemes are mainly based on the proportional integral controller which is generally unable to cope with sinusoidal disturbances, the injected currents are adversely influenced by distorted grid voltages. To address such a problem, this paper proposes an enhanced multiloop control scheme for an LCL-filtered grid-connected inverter under abnormal grid voltage conditions. Since resonant controllers are incorporated into grid-side current control loop, the proposed scheme can guarantee the high quality of injected currents to grid regardless of adverse grid voltage conditions.

While previous studies on Railroad Safety Culture Awareness have been only for a rather superficial appreciation of railroad staff’s safety culture awareness, this dissertation aims at creating desirable ways for the investigation of railroad accidents through analyzing their cognition of work process activities of those employees in charge of accident investigation. The railroad accident investigation inside railway companies is being conducted so that accidents may be analyzed for any problems to be found or deducted in the resolution-oriented way. The regressive analysis using the SPSS 18 Program was applied for the estimation of the correlation among the variables which were to be studied. The study analysis revealed that railroad staff thought their opinions were actively reflected to the procedures of railroad-accident investigation when those investigators executed internal checkup and training with positive attitudes in their organizations. Plus, railroad staff’s cognition result was deducted that still more positive opinions of theirs would be reflected to those investigations in the condition where safety culture awareness and will for safety policy of railroad staff, managers and investigators were to be fostered in terms of Railroad Safety Precaution. Lastly, it was also revealed that the positive recognition of internal inspection will have a positive (+) effect on the rational procedures and utilizations resulting from investigation of accidents along with the fact that the higher management’s awareness of safety culture is, the more positive (+) influence on them there is. © Research India Publications.","Education & training; Internal inspection; Railroad accident investigation; Railroad safety management system; Safety culture awareness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040223885

In the fracture assessment for pipeline, the fracture mechanics parameters. i.e., Jintegral and crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD), have been used, in which these parameters can characterize crack initiation and instability well. In particular, CTOD is widely used for fracture assessment in strain-based design (SBD) concept as well as the transportation pipelines or submarine riser industries subject to large deformation. Many researches have been made to estimate fracture parameters, and several engineering approaches such as General Electric/Electric Power Research Institute (GE/EPRI) and reference stress (RS) method have been suggested. Among them, a GE/EPRI method is one of general estimation approaches based on finite element (FE) analysis, where material behavior is assumed to be characterized by the Ramberg-Osgood (R-O) relation. In GE/EPRI approach, plastic influence functions used to calculate fully plastic term of fracture parameter are calibrated through the detailed FE analyses according to geometries and material properties, respectively. In this context, FE analyses should be systematically performed to estimate CTOD for various cracked pipes based on GE/EPRI method. In the present paper, 3-dimensional (3-D) elastic-plastic FE analyses were carried out to calibrate and propose the fully plastic solutions of CTOD based on GE/EPRI concept for pipes with a semi-elliptical surface crack. The geometric and material variables of a cracked pipe such as pipe thickness, crack length and strain hardening exponent were systematically varied to cover practical ranges of these values. In terms of loading condition, pure bending moment which is most important loading mode in pipeline was considered.

The suggested bimodal electrolyte, which consists of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium halide (EMI-X, X = Br, I) as a redox active couple, shows the three types of energy storage mechanism: a classical EDL capacitance; a pseudo-capacitance from the redox reaction of halide species, such as bromide and iodide; and an EDL capacitance strongly enhanced by ion size effects. When EMITFSI is mixed with small ions, the thickness of the ionic layer becomes thinner and even more ions are packed into the electrode due to the decrement of excluded-volume effects and the increment of electrostatic interactions.

Mixtures of ligands also result from incomplete or partial ligand exchange reactions wherein one that is more tightly bound replaces a weakly bound ligand. Little is known about how the ligand compositions in mixed shell nanoparticles influence biological activity. Further, the impact of residual weakly bound ligands is not understood. To examine the biological impacts due to weakly bound ligands within a mixed ligand shell, a series of six types of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized that have the same core size and possess ligand shells that are predominately either 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MES) or N,N,N-trimethylammoniumethanethiol (TMAT), but contain varying (small) amounts of residual triphenylphosphine (TPP). Each member of the series was carefully examined to determine the core size (by small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy) and ligand shell composition (by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). The influence of the residual, weakly bound TPP ligands upon the biological activity of the nanoparticles (NPs) was evaluated in zebrafish embryos and subsequently in human keratinocyte cells. In the embryos, the presence of residual TPP led to increased cell death that is linked to increased oxidative stress. Control experiments suggest that these effects are not the result of free ligand. Exposure of the keratinocyte cells to the TMAT-containing nanoparticles demonstrated similar results in that residual TPP decreased cell viability, likely through increased ROS generation. The results of these studies suggest that the use of strongly bound ligands that passivate the surface of the inorganic core can prevent ROS and, therefore, yield nanoparticles with reduced biological effects.

The API X70 linepipe steel was fabricated by controlled rolling and accelerated cooling processes, and the microstructure was analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopes and electron backscatter diffraction. Strain aging tests consisting of 1% pre-strain and thermal aging at 200 °C and 250 °C were conducted to simulate U-forming, O-forming, Expansion(UOE) pipe forming and anti-corrosion coating processes. The API X70 linepipe steel was composed of polygonal ferrite, acicular ferrite, granular bainite, and bainitic ferrite whose volume fraction was dependent on the chemical composition and process conditions. As the thermal aging temperature increased, the steel specimens showed more clearly discontinuous type yielding behavior in the tensile stress-strain curve due to the formation of a Cottrell atmosphere. After pre-strain and thermal aging, the yield and tensile strengths increased and the yield-to-tensile strength ratio decreased because yielding and aging behaviors significantly affected work hardening. On the other hand, uniform and total elongations decreased after pre-strain and thermal aging since dislocation gliding was restricted by increased dislocation density after a 1% pre-strain. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","API X70 linepipe steel; Microstructure; Strain aging; Tensile properties","Bainite; Ferrite; Microstructure; Pipelines; Scanning electron microscopy; Steel research; Strain hardening; Stress-strain curves; Tensile properties; Tensile strength; Testing; Thermal aging; Anti-corrosion coating; Chemical compositions; Dislocation densities; Electron back scatter diffraction; Linepipe steel; Strain aging; Tensile strength ratios; Yield and tensile strength; Steel pipe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035786611

The Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) approaches for evaluating structural damage to buildings use the Building Mean Area of Effectiveness MAEBLDG (in square meters in the ground plane) as the Effectiveness Index (EI). MAEBLDG, the numerical values are classified, is used to describe the damage function for building and is area over which a weapon will damage the building. With this MAEBLDG values, the building damage is estimated for specific the building dimensions and weapon delivery accuracy [1]. In general the warhead detonates external to the building in air or after penetrating the roof, walls and floor slabs. It is inadequate to use the fixed MAEBLDG values for the specific building types since the MAEBLDG varies as the detonation location at the building target. Target elements inside buildings are usually personnel or equipment. In many cases, it is only required to kill the function or activity performed inside the building rather than destroy the building itself. Therefore the damage should be considered in two ways:1) structural damage and 2) functional damage. This paper deals with the methodologies to estimate both structural damages of buildings caused by detonations insides or outside the structures without using MAEBLDG concept. This method uses the specific weapon-structure interactions and Monte Carlo to capture the delivery accuracy of the weapon.",,"Ballistics; Buildings; Damage detection; Detonation; Monte Carlo methods; Building damage; Building dimensions; Damage assessments; Damage functions; Functional damage; Numerical values; Structural damages; Weapon deliveries; Structural analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035785337

While voltage sensors are essential to obtain reliable information on the phase angle, these additional components certainly increase the production costs and complexity. In this paper, a voltage-sensorless control scheme for a grid connected inverter using a disturbance observer (DOB) is presented. The grid voltages are estimated by DOB in the stationary reference frame using the current measurements and reference signals. Even though the DOB estimates the grid voltages with reasonable accuracy in the presence of the uncertainty such as the unbalanced condition and harmonic distortion, the resultant waveform shows a phase lag depending on the estimation bandwidth. To overcome this limitation, a phase lead compensation is introduced. By using these techniques, the phase angle of grid voltages can be completely restored even if the phase angle of grid is initially unknown. The proposed scheme is simple and straightforward. In addition, it does not require any additional hardware. The feasibility of the proposed voltage-sensorless control scheme is demonstrated through simulations and experiments using 2 kVA prototype inverter. © 2017 by the authors.","Distributed generation (DG); Disturbance observer (DOB); Estimation of grid voltages and phase angle; Grid connected inverter; Voltage-sensorless control","Electric current measurement; Electric inverters; Uncertainty analysis; Active and reactive power; Disturbance observer; Grid connected inverters; Grid voltage; Phase-lead compensation; Stationary reference frames; Unbalanced condition; Voltage sensorless controls; Sensorless control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035224566

In the stand-alone operation mode, it is desirable that the interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter manages proportional power sharing between the subgrids by transferring power from the under-loaded subgrid to the over-loaded one. In terms of system security, the interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter takes an important role, so proper control strategies need to be established. In addition, it is assumed that a battery energy storage system is installed in one subgrid, and the coordinated control of interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter and battery energy storage system converter is required so that the power sharing scheme between subgrids becomes more efficient. For the purpose of designing a tracking controller for the power sharing by interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid, a droop control method generates a power reference for interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter based on the deviation of the system frequency and voltages first and then interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter needs to transfer the power reference to the over-loaded subgrid. For efficiency of this power transferring, a linear quadratic regulator with exponential weighting for the current regulation of interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter is designed in such a way that the resulting microgrid can operate robustly against various uncertainties and the power sharing is carried out quickly. Simulation results show that the proposed interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter control strategy provides robust and efficient power sharing scheme between the subgrids without deteriorating the secure system operation. © 2017 by the authors.","Battery energy storage system; Hybrid AC/DC microgrid; Interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter; Linear quadratic regulator; Power sharing","Battery storage; Electric batteries; Ac/dc converters; Battery energy storage systems; Hybrid ac/dc microgrid; Linear quadratic regulator; Power sharing; Rectifying circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033788857

This leads to errors and omissions, which results in corrupted data exchanges that are unreliable and compromise the interoperability of BIM models. This research explored the use of two machine learning techniques for identifying anomalies, namely outlier and novelty detection to determine the integrity of IFC classes to BIM entity mappings. Both approaches were tested on three BIM models, to test their accuracy in identifying misclassifications. Results showed that outlier detection, which uses Mahalanobis distances, had difficulties when several types of dissimilar elements existed in a single IFC class and conversely was not applicable for IFC classes with insufficient number of elements. Novelty detection, using one-class SVM, was trained a priori on elements with dissimilar geometry. By creating multiple inlier boundaries, novelty detection resolved the limitations encountered in the former approach, and consequently performed better in identifying outliers correctly.","BIM; IFC; Novelty detection; Outlier detection","Anomaly detection; Electronic data interchange; Learning systems; Mapping; Robotics; Statistics; Authoring tool; Building Information Model - BIM; Corrupted data; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Mahalanobis distances; Manual mapping; Misclassifications; Novelty detection; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032378746

According to the cyclic voltammetry measurements, HAA-CNT shows a better catalytic activity and reaction reversibility for vanadium redox reactions than CNT and CA-CNT because of the chelation ability of the HAA included in the HAA-CNT. With the role of chelating agent, the HAA group interacts well with vanadium ions, promoting their redox reactions. In particular, the HAA-CNT is more effective for the VO2+/VO2+ reaction than the V2+/V3+ reaction because of the larger number of oxygen atoms considered as active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ reaction. The role promoting VO2+/VO2+ reaction is confirmed by measuring charge transfer resistance efficiencies of a single cell VRFB. The chemical structure of the HAA-CNT is determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

While the kernel function can be chosen by human experts with domain knowledge, it is often more principled and promising to learn it directly from data. This idea of kernel learning has been studied considerably in machine learning and pattern recognition. However, most kernel learning algorithms assume fully supervised setups requiring expensive class label annotation for the training data. In this paper we consider kernel learning in the semi-supervised setup where only a fraction of data points need to be labeled. We propose two approaches: the first extends the idea of label propagation along the data similarity graph, in which we simultaneously learn the kernel and impute the labels of the unlabeled data. The second aims to minimize the dual loss in the support vector machines (SVM) classifier learning with respect to the kernel parameters and the missing labels. We provide reasonable and effective approximate solution methods for these optimization problems. These approaches exploit both labeled and unlabeled data in kernel leaning, where we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness on several benchmark datasets with partially labeled learning setups. © The Korean Institute of Intelligent Systems.","Kernel learning; Optimization; Pattern classification; Semi-supervised learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030547588

As one of robust control solutions, model predictive control (MPC) is proposed so the control actions of battery charging and discharging can be planned by considering some constraints such as battery power and state of charge (SoC) limitations. Moving average filter (MAF) is used to generate the output reference for the combined system of PV and BESS where the time window is selected by considering the maximum ramp provided to the system.

Ignoring the spatial statistics (i.e., where in a text they appear) can potentially lead to a suboptimal solution. The key motivation or assumption in this paper is that there may exist underlying segmentation of sentences in a document, and perhaps this partitioning might be intuitively appealing (e.g., each group corresponds to a particular sentiment or gist of arguments). If the segmentation is known somehow, terms belonging to the same/different groups can potentially be treated in an equal/different manner for classification. Based on the idea, we build a novel document classification model comprised of two parts: a sentence tagger that predicts the group labels of sentences, and a classifier that forms the input features as a weighted term frequency vector that is aggregated from all sentences but weighed differently cluster-wise according to the prediction in the first model. We suggest an efficient learning strategy for this model. For several benchmark document classification problems, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields significantly improved classification performance over several existing algorithms. © The Korean Institute of Intelligent Systems.","Document classification; Machine learning; Sequence labeling; Term weighting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030528290

Nevertheless, the utilization of transition metal nitrides still encounters serious challenges due to the chemical instability of these materials during cycling in the presence of oxygen and/or water containing electrolytes, which leads to rapid capacitance fading. Here, we propose a novel structure comprising vanadium nitride encapsulated carbon fibre networks with furrowed porous surfaces prepared by electrospinning followed by an optimal stabilization and carbonization treatments. The resultant electrode shows a high energy density of 53.1-36.0 W h kg-1 at high power densities in the range from 2700-54 000 W kg-1. This performance is superior to previously reported results on other asymmetric supercapacitors. Moreover, an excellent cycling stability of 92.9% at a current density of 80 A g-1 after 10 000 cycles, and a superb electrode flexibility have been recorded.

These issues are caused by key mechanisms being distributed to the IoT network on a large scale, which is why a distributed secure SDN architecture for IoT using the blockchain technique (DistBlockNet) is proposed in this research. It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics.

Still, alongside this increase is an increase in security threats such as crosssite scripting (XSS) threat. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to detect an XSS attack on SNSs. Due to the certain recent features of SNSs webpages such as JavaScript and AJAX, however, the existing approaches are not efficient in combating XSS attack on SNSs. In this paper, we propose a machine learningbased approach to detecting XSS attack on SNSs. In our approach, the detection of XSS attack is performed based on three features: URLs, webpage, and SNSs. A dataset is prepared by collecting 1,000 SNSs webpages and extracting the features from these webpages. Ten different machine learning classifiers are used on a prepared dataset to classify webpages into two categories: XSS or non-XSS. To validate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we evaluated and compared it with other existing approaches.

Although users may not want to disclose their private attributes, these can be inferred from their public behavior on social media. In order to investigate the severity of the leakage of private information in this manner, the purpose of this paper is to present a method to infer undisclosed personal attributes of users based only on the data available on their public profiles on Facebook. Design/methodology/approach - Facebook profile data consisting of 32 attributes were collected for 111,123 Korean users. Inferences were made for four private attributes (gender, age, marital status, and relationship status) based on five machine learning-based classification algorithms and three regression algorithms. Findings - Experimental results showed that users' gender can be inferred very accurately, whereas marital status and relationship status can be predicted more accurately with the authors' algorithms than with a random model. Moreover, the average difference between the actual and predicted ages of users was only 0.5 years. The results show that some private attributes can be easily inferred from only a few pieces of user profile information, which can jeopardize personal information and may increase the risk to dignity. Research limitations/implications - In this paper, the authors' only utilized each user's own profile data, especially text information. Since users in SNSs are directly or indirectly connected, inference performance can be improved if the profile data of the friends of a given user are additionally considered. Moreover, utilizing non-text profile information, such as profile images, can help increase inference accuracy. The authors' can also provide a more generalized inference performance if a larger data set of Facebook users is available. Practical implications - A private attribute leakage alarm system based on the inference model would be helpful for users not desirous of the disclosure of their private attributes on SNSs. SNS service providers can measure and monitor the risk of privacy leakage in their system to protect their users and optimize the target marketing based on the inferred information if users agree to use it. Originality/value - This paper investigates whether private attributes of SNS users can be inferred with a few pieces of publicly available information although users are not willing to disclose them. The experimental results showed that gender, age, marital status, and relationship status, can be inferred by machine-learning algorithms. Based on these results, an early warning system was designed to help both service providers and users to protect the users' privacy. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Age; Facebook; Gender; Machine learning; Marital/relationship status; Private attribute","Alarm systems; Artificial intelligence; Information dissemination; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Risk assessment; Social sciences; Classification algorithm; Design/methodology/approach; Facebook; Gender; Marital/relationship status; Private attribute; Regression algorithms; Social network services; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028776694

Channels can transfer data simultaneously, and each NAND package is composed of multiple dies, which can independently perform NAND operations such as read, write, and erase. Therefore, maximizing the parallel processing capability inside the SSD is important for performance improvement. However, the existing logical address based die binding policy has a disadvantage in that it can concentrate requests only on specific dies, and the existing dynamic binding policy that considers the state of each die has a limitation that it can be used only for the SSD where each die is connected with a dedicated channel. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dynamic die binding policy that considers both channel state and die state for enhancing internal parallelism of general SSDs where multiple dies share a channel. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed policy shows a performance improvement of more than 20% over the logical address based static binding policy. © Research India Publications.","Die binding; NAND flash memory; Parallelism; SSD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028302496

In this scheme, a precoding matrix consisting of orthogonal vectors is employed at the transmitter to enhance the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the user. To analyze and optimize the ORP scheme in terms of cell coverage, we derive the analytical expressions of the downlink coverage probability for two receiver structures, namely, the single-antenna receiver and multiple-antenna receiver with antenna selection. The simulation results show that the analytical expressions accurately capture the coverage behaviors of the systems employing the ORP scheme. It is also shown that the optimal coverage performance is achieved when a single precoding vector is used under the condition that the threshold of the signal-to-noise ratio of the coverage is greater than one. The performance of the ORP scheme is further analyzed when the different random precoder groups are utilized over multiple time slots to exploit precoding diversity. The numerical results show that the proposed ORP scheme over multiple time slots provides a substantial coverage gain over the space-time coding scheme despite its low feedback overhead. © 2013 IEEE.","Cell coverage; massive MIMO; MIMO; random precoding","Antennas; Communication channels (information theory); MIMO systems; Analytical expressions; Cell coverage; Coverage probabilities; Maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios; Multiple input multiple output system; Random pre-coding; Single-antenna receivers; Space-time coding scheme; Signal to noise ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028090201

These properties originate in their unique structure and composition. To leverage these properties in the ultrathin film regime, atomic-level control of thickness, composition, and crystal structure will be essential for creating next-generation perovskite devices. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has the potential to enable these design prospects. However, its future use in the field will be dependent on the quality of the link between ALD process parameters and the perovskite phase. In this overview, we present work on barium and strontium titanate (BTO and STO) ultrathin films for high-k applications. We present ALD process strategies developed and optimized to achieve both desired composition and phase, yielding high dielectric constants and low leakage currents at the same time. We discuss thermal annealing, plasma treatment, and the use of seed layers and specialized precursors to improve the properties of BTO and STO by different enhancement mechanisms. In the ultrathin film regime, the understanding of macroscopic material properties will be dependent on the knowledge of the atomic scale arrangement. In conjunction with advances in manufacturing, we therefore also discuss novel strategies and techniques for characterization that will likely be significant in establishing a valid and reliable ALD process parameter-thin film dielectric property relationship. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atoms; Barium titanate; Characterization; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal structure; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; High-k dielectric; Leakage currents; Perovskite; Plasma applications; Strontium titanates; Thin films; Ultrathin films; Atomic level control; Barium and strontium titanates; Enhancement mechanism; High dielectric constants; Low-leakage current; Macroscopic materials; Process strategies; Thin-film dielectrics; Atomic layer deposition",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027556989

The low-voltage bandgap reference circuit is designed to generate current proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) using a parasitic NPN bipolar junction transistor (BJT). To adjust the output offset and gain of the temperature sensing core, an additional calibration stage based on the differential to the single amplifier (D2S) using a differential difference amplifier (DDA) is designed. A calibration circuit with low power and small size can be implemented using the D2S. Also because of the D2S, the conventional multistage offset and gain calibration circuits can be reduced to a single-stage circuit. The analog output is converted to a digital output using a 12-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A coarse calibration with 5-bit resolution is performed in the analog domain using a DDA-based calibration circuit, and a fine calibration using a 16-bit arithmetic engine is performed in the digital domain. The temperature sensor IC is implemented using a CMOS 0.18 μm process with an active area of 0.2216 mm2. The power consumption is 48.6 μW with a 1.8 V supply.

The purpose of the current study was to identify predictors of naturally occurring transitional shift patterns in physical activity behavior observed over six months among 202 university students. The full set of variables from the transtheoretical model as well as exercise METS was examined. Results indicated that stable active participants reported more exercise METs at baseline than both activity adopters and perpetual preparers in multinomial logistic regression analysis (p<.01). Stable active participants were also significantly different in their cognitive process of change scores compared to activity adopters (p<.05). Activity adopters differed from stable active participants in their initial decisional balance scores (p<.05). These findings should help inform theory development and physical activity interventions and programs.","Physical activity; Transitional shifts; Transtheoretical model; University students",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027047075

In order to measure health risk perceptions a Korean version of self-other risk judgments profile and leisure time exercise questionnaire were used. Results indicated that the study participants, regardless of gender and age, tend to underestimate their vulnerability to the majority of health risk events. The finding revealed that there were significant differences in perception bias toward to health risks by gender and the physical activity level. Furthermore, it is revealed that risk perceptions are directly associated with physical activity participation. The significance of this study lies in the fact that it made a unique contribution to the existing knowledge in exercise and health psychology on relationship between risk perceptions and physical activity.","Adolescent; Health risk perception; Perception bias; Physical activity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027005574

Why, in China, does the central government continue to play a large role in semiconductor development policy? For answering the research question, this study suggests two points. One is that Chinese nationalist ideology is embedded in industrial policy making system in strategic industries like semiconductor technology. Based on the ideology, building indigenous and self-sufficient innovation become overarching policy goals. The other is that IC sectors are considered to belong to critical military technology in the context of global competition between China and the United States in economic and military terms. Among various IT sectors, semiconductor sector is selected as the subject matter. It can be argued that the neo-developmentalism properly can explain China's active IC development policy. The research tries to analyses China's IT industry from neo-developmentalist approach. Due to the top-down implementation, China's government continues to retain control over the selection of priority sectors, technologies and areas of public development.

In the proposed scheme, the system behavior in the future is predicted from the system model in the discrete-time domain. Then, the cost function is selected based on the control objective of system. This cost function is minimized during the optimization process to determine the control signals that minimize the cost function. In addition, since the proposed scheme requires pure sinusoidal reference currents in the stationary frame to work successfully, the moving average filter (MAF) is employed to enhance the performance of the traditional phase lock loop (PLL). Due to the control performance of the FCS-MPC scheme as well as the harmonic disturbance rejection capability of the MAF-PLL, the proposed scheme is able to suppress the harmonic distortion even in the presence of distorted grid condition, while retaining fast transient response. Comparative simulation results of different controllers verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in compensating the harmonic disturbance. To validate the practical feasibility of the proposed scheme, the whole control algorithm is implemented on a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F28335 to control a 2 kW three-phase grid-connected inverter. As a result, the proposed scheme is a promising approach toward improving the current quality of a grid-connected inverter under distorted grid conditions. © 2017 by the authors.","Current control; Distorted grid conditions; DSP TMS320F28335; Grid-connected inverter; Harmonic mitigation; Model predictive control; Power quality","Cost functions; Costs; Digital arithmetic; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Disturbance rejection; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Harmonic analysis; Harmonic distortion; Model predictive control; Phase locked loops; Power quality; Predictive control systems; Transient analysis; Current control strategy; Digital Signal Processor (DSP); DSP TMS320F28335; Grid conditions; Grid connected inverters; Harmonic disturbance rejection; Harmonic mitigation; Three-phase grid connected inverters; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025138901

In the present study, endocrine disruption caused by cefadroxil and cefradine, and its underlying mechanism were investigated by chronic exposure of Daphnia magna (21 d) and Oryzias latipes (120 d). In medaka fish, the effects on growth, mortality, and reproduction, as well as on the levels of hormones and genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis, were investigated after 120 d exposure. In D. magna, the chronic effects on growth were observed at the highest concentration of 83.0 mg L−1 cefadroxil and 80.8 mg L−1 cefradine. The growth of juvenile fish was significantly impaired by exposure to cefradine. Following exposure to cefadroxil and cefradine for 120 d, sex-dependent changes in E2 hormones were observed and their levels were supported by the regulation of genes along the HPG axis. We found that chronic exposure to cefadroxil and cefradine impaired growth and reproduction in a freshwater invertebrate and fish, and altered the levels of sex hormones and genes associated with the HPG axis in fish. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cephalosporin; Endocrine disruption; Growth; Pharmaceutical; Reproduction","Aquatic organisms; Cell proliferation; Drug products; Endocrine disrupters; Endocrinology; Fish; Genes; Growth (materials); Cephalosporin; Chronic effects; Chronic exposure; Endocrine disruption; Freshwater invertebrates; Lethal effects; Oryzias latipes; Reproduction; Hormones; 3(or 17)beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; beta actin; cefadroxil; cefradine; complementary DNA; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 11A; cytochrome P450 19B; cytochrome P450 family 17; estradiol; estrogen receptor alpha; follicle stimulating hormone receptor; gonadorelin; gonadorelin receptor; gonadotropin releasing hormone 1; gonadotropin releasing hormone 2; gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor 1; gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor 2; hormone receptor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; luteinizing hormone beta subunit; luteinizing hormone receptor; messenger RNA; RNA 16S; steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; unclassified drug; cefadroxil; cefradine; endocrine disruptor; fresh water; sex hormone; water pollutant; antibiotics; concentration (composition); crustacean; endocrine disruptor; endocrine system; fish; growth; mortality; reproduction; sex hormone; toxicology; acute toxicity; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; body height; chronic toxicity; controlled study; Daphnia magna; egg production; embryo; female; genetic regulation; genetic transcription; growth; hormone release; hypothalamus hypophysis gonad system; long term exposure; male; mortality; nonhuman; Oryzias latipes; reproduction; animal; Daphnia; drug effects; endocrine system; Oryzias; physiology; toxicity; toxicity testing; water pollutant; Daphnia magna; Invertebrata; Oryzias latipes; Oryziinae; Animals; Cefadroxil; Cephradine; Daphnia; Endocrine Disruptors; Endocrine System; Fresh Water; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Male; Oryzias; Reproduction; Toxicity Tests, Chronic; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025097311

For auto-cleaning, we suggest alternative cleaning frequencies of a single-armed cluster tool that periodically clean the inside of process modules based on the Theory of Constraints.

In buildings, heat loss through windows accounts for 20%-40% of cooling and heating loads. In this work, airtightness of sliding and lift sliding type windows and its effect on infiltration and heating loads of a building has been studied. Infiltrations according to window types and with/without lock operations are measured following KS F 2292, a Korean standard for measuring window air infiltration. STAR-CCM+ (CD-adapco 2014), a thermal-fluid computational program; CONTAM (NIST 2011), a network based ventilation simulation program; and TRNSYS17 (SEL 2009), a dynamic simulation program, have been used to calculate infiltration rates and heating loads of a building accounting for various factors, including window types, window elevation and horizontal position in a building, and with/without lock operations. When all locks are on, infiltration of lift sliding window is 1.68m3/(m2·h) (0.092fc/fft2-min]), 15% less than that of sliding with 1.98 m3/(m2·h) (0.108ft3/[ft2·min]). When locksare off, infiltration of the lift sliding window is 5.83 m3/(m2·h) (0.319 ft3/[ft2·min]), 121% greater than that of sliding which is 2.64 m3/(m2·h) (0.144ft3/[ft2·min]). Simulation results indicate that average heating load of the lift sliding window with lock on is 17.12 W/m2 (5.427 Btu/h·ft2), 1.1% less than that of the sliding window, which is 17.31 W/m2 (5.487 Btu/h·ft2). Peak heating load of lift sliding window is 37.46 W/m2 (11.875 Btu/h·ft2), 6.7%&lt; less than that of the sliding window, which is 40.17 W/m2 (12.734 Btu/h·ft2). When the lock is not engaged, the average heating loads of sliding and lift sliding windows compared to lock engaged increase from 17.31 to 17.36 W/m2 (5.487 to 5.503 Btu/h·ft2) and from 17.12 to 17.82 W/m2 (5.427 to 5.649Btu/h·ft2), which are 0.3% and 4.1% increases, respectively. The average heating loads of 1st, 8th, and 15th floor becomes 18.16,15.32, and 18.45 W/m2 (5.757,4.856, and 5.849 Btu/h·ft2), respectively, which shows the effect of elevation. The heating load is highest at the top floor due to heat loss at the roof. The average heating loads of side house and middle house are 17.93 and 16.69 W/m2 (5.684 and 5.291 Btu/h·ft2), respectively, which shows the effect of horizontal position within the same floor. For a side-located house, heating load increase due to infiltration is 3.9%, compared to no infiltration, which is 17.25 W/m2 (5.468Btu/h·ft2). For a middle-located house, heating load increase due to infiltration is 5.1%, compared to no infiltration, which is 15.88 W/m2 (5.034 Btu/h·ft2). The pressure coefficient is higher at the center of the building, resulting in larger infiltration. This study shows that window type selection, window location, and lock operation are important for reducing infiltration and heating load. © 2017 ASHRAE.",,"Decoding; Elevators; Energy utilization; Floors; Heat losses; Houses; Locks (fasteners); Air infiltration; Computational program; Infiltration rate; No infiltration; Pressure coefficients; Simulation program; Thermal fluids; Total energy consumption; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021045982

Foranair transport process, accurate measurement of airflow is related to the comfort level of buildings and the realization of high-quality products. Measurement of airflow is difficult because of complicated flow characteristics and no-nuniform velocity distribution. In this study, we have conducted comparative analysis of typical flow-meters used in the industry for measuring airflow and intend to propose a new type of portable multi-nozzle airflow meter with exit pressure control that is more accurate than the existing on-site flow measurement devices. A stationary multi-nozzle flow measurement system, FM-1000, was built following the ANSI/ASHRAE 51-1999 standard (ANSI/ASHRAE 1999) and compared with a mass flow-meter that is considered accurate and that confirmed that the average deviation was 0.36%. Using this stationary multi nozzle flow measurement system, performances of portable anemometers and flow-meters that are widely used for on-site flow rate measurements were tested. Due to limitations of these portable measuring devices, average errors were 34.1% for vane type, 37.4% for hot wire type and 9.8% for hood type. A portable small scale multi nozzle flow-meter with exit pressure control that was developed in this study has advantages of easy handling and accurate measurement in the field and showed an error of only 0.93%. © 2017 ASHRAE.",,"Air; Flow measurement; Flow rate; Nozzles; Pressure control; Accurate measurement; Comparative analysis; Flow rate measurements; High-quality products; Industrial facilities; Manufacturing process; Measurement device; Measurement system; Flowmeters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021033977

Herein, we report a unique and facile approach to synthesise a spoilt tofu-derived carbon framework with embedded ultrasmall Sn nanocrystals (SCS) derived from food waste (such as spoilt tofu) using simple impregnation and carbonisation. The unique architecture of SCS was due to the porous structure of spoilt tofu and was utilised as an anode for Li-ion batteries. The optimised SCS architecture shows excellent electrochemical performance with outstanding cycling stability (621 mA h g−1 capacity retention up to 100 cycles) and excellent high-rate performance (250 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1). Thus, this facile approach provides helpful synergistic effects in terms of structural stability, electrochemical active surface area, and shorter diffusion pathways for Li ions.

For comparison, the LMO particles were prepared using the solid-state reaction method.

Wide-area railroad is for handling the immense demands for daily transportation between cities or provinces by any relevant laws, the function and role of which is different from that of urban railroad constructed for smooth operation of urban traffic. But, as a matter of fact, the distinction between wide-area railroad and urban railroad is ambiguous. The analysis of inter-city or inter-province travel pattern in metropolitan area revealed the average speed of 45km/h, which is approximate to that of 47km/h in the system of wide-area railroad, which indicates that the role and the function for speed of express trains with the average speed of 58km/h is not enough. It was found that scheduled speed and stop spacing of express trains on Korean wide-area railroad were similar to or higher than those of the wide-area railroad system in Tokyo metropolis area of Japan where both local and express trains are served while the running frequency and the running distance of Japanese express trains were 42~46% and 180% of those of local ones respectively, which figures are a lot higher than those of Korea, 7~23% and 47~111% respectively. So, this paper analyzed problems of Korean wide-area railroad operation and suggested strategies of express-centric operating. As a result, it was saved average 10~30 minute when it replaced the express-centric with the local-centric.

A comparative analysis was used to obtain different perspectives between public and private sectors. Findings: A total of 39 client values were identified in this study. Clients for disaster reconstruction services put more emphasis on values such as timeliness, availability of resources, competency, building a trust-based relationship, financial stability, and communication techniques than contract price. Public and private clients have a different perspective regarding the importance of the identified values, while these are not statistically significant for the most important values. Research limitations/implications: The construction literature is focussed on business-as-usual rather than post-disaster reconstruction. To ensure that reconstruction programmes after a disaster are successfully implemented, it is necessary to identify and prioritize the client values within contracting services. Focussing the attention of the service providers on these values is believed to have the greatest impact on the programmes’ success.

The environment is implemented on top of two embedded platforms with different architectures, ARM and x86. First, Xenomai is ported on the target architecture in order to achieve real-time characteristics and to provide real-time mechanisms for inter-process communication used by the EtherCAT master. Although applications that run in the kernel space give better performance, programming is very difficult due to limited user-friendly functions. It is also fragile that a single mistake can easily crash the whole system. On the other hand, user space applications are uncomplicated and debugging is also simplified, with lesser risk of damaging hardware or reference memory. Thus, we developed a real-time application in the user space of Xenomai to actuate multi-axis servo drives focusing on the periodicity and execution time as performance measurements. The execution time of the EtherCAT master is evaluated and compared for each platform by calculating the difference between the timestamps during send and receipt of the EtherCAT frames. The experiment is performed both in short-term and long-term to test the consistency of each platform in carrying out hard real-time control applications. © Research India Publications.","Embedded linux; EtherCAT; Performance analysis; Real-time; Xenomai",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019095127

Moreover, AP is coupled with support vector regression (SVR) to accommodate weather forecast parameters for improved accuracy of a longer prediction horizon; thus, a hybrid model is also proposed. To increase system reliability during peak hours, this prediction model also aims to provide more accurate peak-loading conditions when considerable changes in temperature and humidity happen. The objective of going hybrid is to estimate an increase or decrease on the expected peak load demand by presenting the total MW per Celsius degree change (MW/C°) as criterion for providing a warning signal to system operators to prepare necessary storage facilities and sufficient reserve capacities if urgently needed by the system. The prediction model is applied using actual 2014 load demand of mainland South Korea during the summer months of July to September to demonstrate the performance of the proposed prediction model.

An openswitch fault in a PWM VSI often introduces over-current stress to other electric components and can be easily propagated. Thus, it may lead to a severe secondary damage in the entire drive system. Furthermore, the open-switch fault produces increased current harmonics and distortion as well as large torque pulsation. In contrast to the conventional schemes, the proposed fault detection scheme uses the moving filter to process the current information, which facilitates a fast detection of fault without increasing the computational burden severely. The proposed scheme is not only immune to false alarms due to inexact detection, but also independent of operating conditions because it uses normalization quantity. The proposed scheme detects a fault by online basis without any additional hardware while keeping control at the same time. To verify the proposed fault detection scheme, the entire system is constructed using digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F28335. The comparative simulations and experimental results validate the practical usefulness of the proposed scheme. © Research India Publications.","Fast fault detection; Moving filter; Open-switch; PWM-VSI; Reliability improvement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017284189

Thus, we synthesized unique composites of high-dispersed Si and titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles in the CNF matrix (Si/TiO2/CNF) using the complexation of TiO2 nanoparticles in order to the high-dispersed Si nanoparticles.

Low impact development (LID) is regarded as one of the most suitable solutions for urban stormwater management and thus the U.S. EPA's (Environmental Protection Agency) SWMM5.1 (Storm Water Management Model) added the hydrological simulation function for LID structures in 2009. However, SWMM5.1 cannot consider the optimal or best physical specifications of LID design and planning fitted to a study area, nor can it instantly derive the best combination for multiple LID designs and plans. Therefore, in this study, a web-based decision support system (DSS) for the EPA'sSWMM5.1, referred to as theWater Management Analysis Module (WMAM) is used to decide the most effective specifications of design and planning parameters for LID structure. This study was carried out over an urban catchment of University Technology Malaysia campus located in Johor, Malaysia. The hydrologic cycles with and without LID were simulated using EPA SWMM5.1. The sensitivity analysis and multiple scenario analysis were performed using WMAM. As a result, the effective specification of LID design parameters indicates that peak flow is reduced to 20.95% and 17.5% for two sub-catchments, S1 (highest by area) and S6 (lowest by area) by installing an LID structure. Thus, this study provides a tool for the best solution for what values for physical parameters will be the best for a specified LID type and what capacities can achieve the particular objectives using WMAM. © 2017 by the authors.","Low impact development; Malaysia; SWMM; Water Management Analysis Module (WMAM)","Catchments; Decision support systems; Environmental Protection Agency; Floods; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Specifications; Storms; Urban planning; Water management; Best management practices; Low impact development; Malaysia; Management analysis; Storm water management model; SWMM; Urban stormwater management; Web-based decision support systems; Structural design; best management practice; decision support system; design; peak flow; runoff; scenario analysis; sensitivity analysis; water management; Johor; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014950054

Dynamic programming is a promising solution for energy management problem of the hybrid electric vehicle, yet global optimality can only be achieved with preview driving cycle information due to its non-causal property. As recent driving cycle prediction algorithms facilitate the use of preview driving cycle information, rule-based energy management strategy of the hybrid electric vehicle using dynamic programming optimization is presented in this study, under the assumption that the preview driving cycle information is already given. The strategy is composed of dynamic programming calculation and the rule-based control strategy using that calculation. Dynamic programming analyzes optimal control and battery state of charge trajectory in accordance with the vehicle travel distance, with given predicted driving cycle information. The proposed rule-based strategy distributes vehicle’s demand power into the engine and the electric motor, to follow target battery state of charge trajectory acquired from dynamic programming. To validate the control strategy, simulation is conducted on various standard driving cycles. The energy management strategy shows improved fuel economy performance for diverse driving cycles. © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Battery state of charge; Dynamic programming; Energy management strategy; Hybrid electric vehicle; Optimization","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric machine control; Fuel economy; Hybrid vehicles; Optimization; Secondary batteries; Trajectories; Battery state of charge; Control strategies; Economy performance; Energy management strategies; Management problems; Rule-based control strategies; Rule-based strategy; Trajectory information; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013792179

In this paper, we measured the temporal response property of Si nanowire-heater through infrared microscopy. Nanowire-heaters were fabricated using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer with Si heights of 15 μm and 30 μm, respectively. In order to compare the change of the temporal response property according to the structural shape, four different types of nanowire-heater were fabricated using the basic MEMS processes. To measure the transient temperature change of nanowireheaters, the voltage of square wave with constant pulse duration was applied using a function generator. According to the pulse duration, the transient temperature distribution for four different types of Si nanowire-heater was measured using infrared (IR) microscope. Consequently, regardless of the structural shape and width difference of Si nanowire-heaters, they showed a fast response time less than 1 ms when the voltage with 500 Hz pulse duration was repeatedly applied. Also, the simulated results using COMSOL multiphysics showed that they had around 100 μs response time which is around 10 times faster than the maximum time resolution of the IR microscope. © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Infrared (IR) microscope; Nanowire-Heater; Silicon (Si) nanowire; Thermal response time","Microscopes; Nanowires; Silicon on insulator technology; Structural frames; Temperature; Comsol multiphysics; Fast response time; Infrared microscopy; Silicon on insulator wafers; Temporal response; Thermal response; Transient temperature; Transient temperature distributions; Silicon wafers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013775628

To investigate the effect of tear protein deposition on the change in oxygen permeability (Dk) of soft contact lenses (SCL). Methods. Three hydrogel lenses (polymacon, nelfilcon A, and etafilcon A) and two silicon hydrogel lenses (lotrafilcon A and balafilcon A) were investigated. Etafilcon A lenses were incubated in artificial tear solution for 1, 6, 12, and 48 h, whereas the other SCL were incubated for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Oxygen permeability was measured using the polarographic method, and lenses were stacked in four layers to correct the boundary effect. Results. The Dk of all investigated SCL was decreased by the protein deposition. Silicone hydrogel lenses showed a smaller deposition of artificial tear proteins than conventional hydrogel lenses. However, their Dk was reduced twofold than those of 3 conventional hydrogel lenses when compared at the same level of protein deposition. Despite a large amount of total deposited protein in etafilcon A lenses, their Dk was more stable than other SCL. Conclusions. From the results, it was revealed that the Dk of SCL is different from the value provided by manufacturers because of the tear protein deposition on surface and/or in pore of SCL; however, the degree of Dk change in SCL was not simply correlated with the amount of tear protein deposition. Thus, it is considered that the correlation between tear protein deposition and properties of lens materials affects Dk change. © 2017 Se Eun Lee et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013466023

Standardized scales were used to measure physical activity and its related social ecological variables. The results indicated that physical activity was significantly correlated with self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, family support, friend support, availability of facilities, and quality of facilities. All of psychological, social environmental, and physical environmental variables had a significant direct path to explain physical activity. In addition, self-efficacy and perceived benefits significantly mediated the relationship between family support and physical activity, and while the relationship between availability of facilities and physical activity was substantially mediated by perceived barriers.

The Agreement supports the establishment of new cooperative approaches including internationally transferred mitigation outcomes, through which individual countries can meet their nationally determined contributions. Hydropower projects, however, are in danger of being left out in the new regime mainly due to its dubious position as a renewable energy source. Hydropower in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has been criticized for non-conformance to additionality and sustainability objectives originally set out in the Kyoto Protocol. To confirm such issues, and to provide recommendations that may mitigate them, this study conducted an econometric analysis of 2717 hydropower projects in the CDM pipeline leading up to 2016. Specifically, a logit model was constructed to identify the main drivers for registration success. Results of the analysis showed the capacity and expected carbon credits of hydropower projects to be the dominant factors for registration, rather than their financial requirements or technological barriers. Most problematically, large scale projects not requiring carbon credits were registered, while their social and environmental impacts have not been extensively scrutinized. Policy recommendations to rectify the verification process are proposed, so that when implemented, the right hydropower projects may be included in the new market mechanisms of the post-2020 regime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Clean Development Mechanism; Emission reductions; Hydropower; Paris Agreement; Sustainable development","Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Energy policy; Sustainable development; Clean Development Mechanism; Emission reduction; Global climate changes; Hydropower; Renewable energy source; Social and environmental impact; Sustainability objectives; Technological barriers; Hydroelectric power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011995463

Pilots set the flight points on a map in order to navigate to the imaging point where surveillance or patrolling is required. However, there is the limit denoting the information such as absolute altitudes and angles. Therefore, it is required to set the information accurately. This paper hereby proposes a method to construct environmental symmetric big data using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during flight by designating the imaging and non-imaging points for surveillance and patrols. The K-Means-based algorithm proposed in this paper is then employed to divide the imaging points, which is set by the pilot, into K clusters, and K imaging points are determined using these clusters. Flight data are then used to set the points to which the UAV will fly. In our experiment, flight records were gathered through an UAV in order to monitor a stadium and the imaging and non-imaging points were set using the proposed method and compared with the points determined by a traditional K-Means algorithm. Through the proposed method, the cluster centroids and cumulative distance of its members were reduced by 87.57% more than with the traditional K-Means algorithm. With the traditional K-Means algorithm, imaging points were not created in the five points desired by the pilot, and two incorrect points were obtained. However, with the proposed method, two incorrect imaging points were obtained. Due to these two incorrect imaging points, the two points desired by the pilot were not generated. © 2017 by the authors.","Demonstration-based learning; K-means algorithm; Unmanned aerial vehicle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011664460

Feed-in-Tariffs (FITs) offer cost based prices for renewable electricity to compete with conventional energy producers. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) issues certified emission reduction (CER) credits that generate additional revenues, enhancing renewable projects’ return on investment. This study investigated how these subsidies impact the financial returns on Korea's CDM projects. An investment analysis was performed on four cases including solar, hydropower, wind and landfill gas projects. Revenues from electricity sales, FITs and CERs were compared using financial indicators to measure their relative contributions on profitability. Results indicate that CDM is partial towards large scale projects with high emission reductions. Moreover, conflicts with FIT schemes can deter small scale, capital intensive projects from pursuing registration. The analysis highlights CDM's bias for particular project types, which is in part due to its impartiality towards carbon credit prices. It also reveals that Korea, a key benefactor of CDM, is susceptible to such biases, as demonstrated by the disproportionate distribution of issued CERs. Improving incentives for bundled, small scale projects, CER price differentiation, and excluding domestic subsidies during additionality testing are proposed as possible reforms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Certified Emission Reductions; Clean Development Mechanism; Feed-in-Tariffs; Sustainable Development","Costs; Emission control; Energy policy; Forestry; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Certified emission reductions; Clean Development Mechanism; Feed-in tariff; Price differentiation; Relative contribution; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy projects; Return on investments; Investments; alternative energy; clean development mechanism; emission control; profitability; renewable resource; sustainable development; tariff structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011303975

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested three factors of vulnerability; namely, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were used in this study with respect to water quantity and quality. In this study, 16 water quantity indicators and 13 water quality indicators were selected to identify the vulnerability using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Environmental and socioeconomic data were obtained from the national statistics database, and hydrological data were simulated using the calibrated Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Expert surveys and Shannon entropy method were used to determine subjective and objective weights for all indicators, individually. As a result, water quantity-vulnerable sub-basins were associated with high water use and water leakage ratios. Water quality-vulnerable sub-basins were associated with relatively high values of maximum consecutive dry days and heatwave days. The water quantity indices of both weighting methods showed relatively similar spatial distributions, while the distribution of water quality indices was distinct. These results suggest that considering different weighting methods is important for assessing the robust water resource vulnerability of sub-basins. © 2017 by the authors.","Han River basin; Robust water resource vulnerability; Shannon entropy; TOPSIS","analytical method; database; environmental indicator; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; multicriteria analysis; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; vulnerability; water management; water quality; water resource; water use; China; Guangdong; Han Basin [Guangdong]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011117211

The Korean Government plans to enhance the ratio of combustible waste converted into SRF from 16% in 2014 to 100% in 2020 by increasing the number of facilities that make and use SRF. This paper attempts to investigate empirically the Korean public's willingness to pay (WTP) for expanding the use of SRF. The WTP data were obtained from a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey of 1000 households. Because a considerable number of respondents (62.6%) gave a zero WTP response, we applied a spike model to treat the WTP data with zero observations. The spike model fitted the data well considering that all the coefficient estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. The yearly mean WTP was computed as KRW 2479 (USD 2.17) per household for the next 10 years, which is also statistically meaningful at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 46.4 billion (USD 40.5 million) per year. The present value of the total public WTP amounts to KRW 369.0 billion (USD 322.3 million) using a social discount rate of 5.5%. We can conclude that Korean households are ready to shoulder some of the financial burden to expand the use of SRF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Solid refuse fuel; Spike model; Willingness to pay","Economic analysis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Combustible wastes; Contingent valuations; Dichotomous choice contingent valuation; Discount rates; Korean Government; Present value; Spike models; Willingness to pay; Resource valuation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010223620

This paper presents a new attribute weighting method for the k-modes algorithm that utilizes impurity measures such as entropy and Gini impurity. The proposed algorithm considers both the distribution of categories of attributes within the same cluster and between different clusters.

In modeling histograms, although recent Bayesian topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation and its variants are shown to be successful, they often suffer from computational overhead for inference of a large number of hidden variables. In this paper we consider a different modeling strategy of forming a dictionary of base histograms whose convex combination yields a histogram of observable text/image document. The dictionary entries are learned from data, which establishes direct/indirect association between specific topics/keywords and the base histograms. From a learned dictionary, the coding of an observed histogram can provide succinct and salient information useful for classification. One of our main contributions is that we propose a very efficient dictionary learning algorithm based on the recent Nesterov’s smooth optimization technique in conjunction with analytic solution methods for quadratic minimization sub-problems. Not alone the faster theoretical convergence rate, also in real time, our algorithm is 20–30 times faster than general-purpose optimizers such as interior-point methods.

Also, we analyze the response time of real-time mechanisms and its performance for inter-task communication (ITC) between real-time tasks. Response time of real-time mechanisms is an important measure to predict the realtime performance of each platform. The performance evaluation is performed both in kernel space and user space using the metrics of jitter, to estimate the periodicity of the cyclic task, and execution time of three real-time mechanisms including semaphore, message queue, and message pipe. The results of this study would serve as a guideline in developing real-time systems on low cost open embedded hardware platforms using the real-time Linux extension of Xenomai.

In this study, synthetic cysteine derivatives (DBLS-21, -24, and -33) were developed containing syringic acid and cysteine moieties (L-cysteine ethyl ester, N-acetyl cysteine methyl ester, and Nacetyl cysteine ethyl ester), and their antioxidative and whitening activities were evaluated. The cellular protective effect (τ50) of DBLS-21 was 51.1 min at 50 μM on1O2-induced hemolysis of erythrocytes. This activity was slightly higher than that of α-tocopherol (43.6 min) as a lipophilic antioxidant. In the melanogenesis inhibitory effect, DBLS-21, -24, and -33 was 1.6-, 1.8-, and 2.5-fold higher than arbutin, respectively. In particular, DBLS-21 and -33 was 112.8- and 6.1-fold higher than arbutin, respectively (293.4 μM) on tyrosinase inhibition activity (IC50). But DBLS-24 had no tyrosinase inhibitory activity.

The SP-tree is based on the index clustering technique called the segment-page clustering (SP-clustering). Most relevant index pages are widely scattered on a disk due to dynamic page allocation, and thus many random disk accesses are required during the query processing. The SP-clustering avoids the scattering by storing the relevant nodes contiguously in a segment that contains a sequence of contiguous disk pages and improves the query performance by offering sequential disk access within a segment. Experimental results demonstrate that the SP-clustering improves the query performance up to several times compared with the traditional ones with respect to the total elapsed time. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Index clustering; Multidimensional index; Sequential disk access","Electrical engineering; Mathematical techniques; Clustering techniques; Index clustering; Multi-dimensional index structures; Multidimensional index; nocv1; Random disk access; Sequential access; Sequential disk access; Total elapsed time; Ubiquitous computing",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007374907

This randomized controlled trial examined whether a combination of Korean mistletoe extract (KME) supplement and exercise affected muscle mass, muscle function, and targeted molecular expressions. Sixty-seven subjects aged 55–75 years were assigned to placebo, low-dose (1 g/d), or high-dose (2 g/d) of KME for 12 weeks. The body composition was significantly changed in the high-dose group during the intervention period as determined by skeletal muscle mass (P = 0.040), fat free mass (P = 0.042), soft lean mass (P = 0.023), skeletal muscle index (P = 0.041), fat-free mass index (P = 0.030), percent body fat (P = 0.044), and fat mass to lean mass ratio (P = 0.030). Knee strength was measured by Cybex, demonstrating a significant effect in the KME groups compared to the placebo group (P = 0.026 for peak torque and P = 0.057 for set total work), which was more pronounced after adjusting for age, gender, protein, and energy intake (P = 0.009 for peak torque and P = 0.033 for set total work). The dynamic balance ability was remarkably improved in the high-dose group over a 12-week period as determined by Timed “Up and Go” (P = 0.005 for fast walk test and P = 0.024 for ordinary walk test). Consistent with these results, RT-PCR, multiplex analyses, and immunocytofluorescence staining revealed that a high-dose KME supplementation was effective for suppressing intracellular pathways related to muscle protein degradation, but stimulating those related to myogenesis. In particular, significant differences were found in atrogin-1 mRNA (P = 0.002 at a single administration and P = 0.001 at a 12-week administration), myogenin mRNA (P < 0.0001 at a single administration and P = 0.040 at a 12-week administration), and insulin growth factor 1 receptor phosphorylation (P = 0.002 at a 12-week administration).

The free surface evolution of sloshing with a low filling ratio is so violent that a local mesh coarsening/refinement (LCR) technique can be effectively used to resolve the flow field near the interface of two immiscible fluids. Since an implicit discretization method was employed to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, an assembled global matrix was generated using a dynamic compressed sparse row (CSR) method. The proposed algorithm was validated by comparing the simulation results with those of a non-adaptive method with respect to wall impact pressures and mass conservation. Numerical results showed that relative mass error strongly depends on mesh resolution near the interface. Results of adaptive simulations were found to be comparable with those of non-adaptive simulations only if a similar mesh resolution was used near the interface. Moreover, adaptive simulations were about two times faster than the non-adaptive ones. The effect of the adaptive zone and smoothing zone on the impact pressure was also examined for the proposed algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic adaptation; Finite element method; Local coarsening/refinement; Sloshing; Unstructured mesh","Discrete event simulation; Fuel sloshing; Mesh generation; Navier Stokes equations; Adaptive simulation; Compressed sparse row; Discretization method; Dynamic adaptations; Dynamic mesh adaptation; Incompressible Navier Stokes equations; Local coarsening/refinement; Unstructured meshes; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997830816

Metamaterials (MMs) can absorb or affect EM waves towards desired directions. There are a number of ongoing studies on the development of MAs for EM waves. However, as of yet no method of quantitatively evaluating the EM waves absorbed by MM has been clearly defined. It has been explained that the EM characteristics caused by MMs can be explained using Poyntings vector theorem. However, it is necessary to develop a practical alternative to the use of this theorem, because the theoretical evaluations have limitations due to the ideal properties of an antenna for measurement of EM waves and the size of MMs. Thus, this study has suggested that factors to be considered in measuring the characteristics of EM waves absorbed by MMs include distance between MM and antenna, performance characteristics of antenna, conditions of test field, measuring instrument, and measuring system. With a measurement system established, the MMs EM characteristics, which are represented by the amounts of EM waves absorbed and controlled by MMs, can be measured by generating EM waves from the antenna and comparing the differences between when there is a MM absorber and when there is no MM absorber at a location which is a certain distance (far-field) away from the source of the EM waves. This study has shown the amounts of EM waves absorbed by and controlled by MMs by using antennas with 2.4 and 4 GHz bandwidths. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption measurement; Electromagnetic-wave measurement; Electromagnetic-wave propagation; Metamaterials","Antennas; Circular waveguides; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Metamaterials; Microwave antennas; Absorption measurements; Measurement system; Measuring instruments; Measuring systems; Performance characteristics; Test fields; Theoretical evaluation; Wave absorption; Electromagnetic waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992413336

Both types of specimens had a dual-phase microstructure consisting of retained austenite (γR) and ferrite (α) after intercritical annealing at 640 °C for 30 min. The phase fractions and the chemical composition of γR were almost identical in both types of specimens. However, their microstructural morphology was different. The HRA specimens had lath-shaped morphology and the CRA specimens had globular-shaped morphology. We find that both types of specimens showed transition in fracture mode from ductile and partly quasi-cleavage fracture to intergranular fracture with decreasing impact test temperature from room temperature to −196 °C. The HRA specimen had higher ductile to brittle transition temperature and lower low-temperature impact toughness compared to the CRA specimen. This was due to intergranular cracking in the HRA specimens along prior γ grain boundaries decorated by C, Mn and P. In the CRA specimen intergranular cracking occurred along the boundaries of the very fine α and α′ martensite grains. The results reveal that cold working prior to intercritical annealing promotes the elimination of the solute-decorated boundaries of coarse prior γ grains through the recrystallization of αʹ martensite prior to reverse transformation, hence improving the low-temperature impact toughness of medium Mn steel. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.","Brittle-ductile transition; Charpy impact test; Intercritical annealing; Medium Mn steel; Toughness; Ultrafine-grained materials","Annealing; Austenite; Brittle fracture; Cold rolling; Cold working; Cracks; Ductile fracture; Fracture toughness; Grain boundaries; Manganese; Martensite; Martensitic steel; Metal cladding; Microstructure; Morphology; Steel sheet; Temperature; Toughness; Brittle ductile transitions; Ductile-to-brittle transition temperature; Intercritical annealing; Low temperature impact toughness; medium-Mn steels; Microstructural morphology; Prior austenite grain boundaries; Ultrafine grained materials; Charpy impact testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990218423

Using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and post-polymerization synthesis, we prepared a series of quaternary ammonium fluoride-based polymer brushes designed to absorb and degrade OPs. Specifically, a polymer brush was formed using 2-dimethylamino-ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) as monomer, which, following post-polymerization quaternization of the tertiary amine with alkylating agents and fluoride ion exchange, afforded the OP-reactive polymer surfaces. Poly(DMAEMA) brushes were grown to thicknesses of ~100 nm on silicon wafers and glass slides and characterized by ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Quaternization and subsequent ion exchange of the brushes were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The interaction of the brushes with OPs was evaluated using the OP-based pesticide coumaphos, through the presence of the highly fluorescent degradation product chlorferon; analyzed qualitatively via fluorescence microscopy; and confirmed via nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. We found that the fluoride form of the brush reliably degraded coumaphos deposited via controlled solution-based applications and aerosol applications (electrohydrodynamic jetting) and from microcontact printing of the dried solid directly onto the brush. No degradation was seen for coumaphos deposited on poly(DMAEMA) or the iodide form of the quaternized brush. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The total amount of organic carbon recorded during the period 2000–2014 was 11.4 times that of SO42−. The amounts of organic carbon and SO42− removed through landfill gas were 16.0 and 6.1 %, respectively, during the same period. The COD/SO42− ratio of the leachate was 10.9 in 2001, which drastically decreased to 4.5 in 2007 by the increase in CH4 concentration; thereafter, no great variations in this ratio were observed up to 2014. It was found that the concentration of H2S sharply increased after methane concentrations reached their highest levels. The year around 2006 may be the equilibrium time point among the waste supply, LFG generation, and leachate water quality. In conclusion, if the ratio of landfill organic carbon to SO42− is about 10, and the COD/SO42− ratio is about 9 in the state of equilibrium, there appears to be no hindrance to the generation of CH4 and H2S. © 2015, Springer Japan.","COD/SO42− ratio; Demolition waste; Hydrogen sulfide; Leachate; Sulfate reducing bacteria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944916352

Daily rainfall data from 64 stations in South Korea (SK) and 27 stations in North Korea (NK) were used to identify temporal patterns in the rainfall characteristics of both regions using seven rainfall indices, such as the total annual rainfall and annual number of wet days. This study suggests the use of three steps in identifying meteorological hazards based on two statistical analyses. In step 1, we conducted a trend analysis of a 10-year moving average of the rainfall index using the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test. Most stations (65.6 %) in SK exhibit clear increasing trends in five indices, whereas far fewer have data indicating any trends in five of the indices in NK (25.9 %). In step 2, abrupt changes in all rainfall indices were identified using a Bayesian Change Point (BCP) approach. The results contradict those from the MK trend analysis. The proportion of stations in NK where trends were identified is much higher than that in SK. In step 3, the results from the two previous steps were integrated to identify the meteorological hazards based on the identified trend and change point. The BCP approach can be used to identify meteorological hazards that MK cannot, as the former approach focuses on the change point during the entire period. As a result, meteorological stability at the sites of weather stations can be identified, and then the meteorological hazards across the entire Korean peninsula can be spatially interpolated. Although SK and NK are located on the same peninsula, distinct differences in the trends were observed. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"Bayesian analysis; hazard assessment; meteorological hazard; precipitation (climatology); temporal variation; trend analysis; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941711395
