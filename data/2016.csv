Perturbatively, logarithms of R can appear, which for narrow jets can lead to large corrections. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we introduce the fragmentation function to a jet (FFJ), which describes the fragmentation of a parton into a jet. We discuss how these objects are related to the standard jet functions. Calculating the FFJ to next-to-leading order, we show that these objects satisfy the standard Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations, with a natural scale that depends upon R. By using the standard renormalization group evolution, we can therefore resum logarithms of R. We further use the soft-collinear effective theory to prove a factorization theorem where the FFJs naturally appear, for the fragmentation of a hadron within a jet with small R. Finally, we also show how this formalism can be used to resum the ratio of jet radii for a subjet to be emitted from within a fat jet. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012005931

Rosin, which is a natural product derived from pine trees, is chemically bonded with a rigid PAA polymer, which affords additional adhesion and elasticity of the PAA backbone, resulting in an effective binder with optimal properties. The hybridization of PAA-Rosin is achieved through an efficient one-step process, and the chemical structures of the components are systematically confirmed. In terms of the cycling performance, the cell based on PAA-Rosin shows excellent specific capacity retention (65.2%) with superior utilization of silicon/graphite composites even after 200 cycles. In addition, the PAA-Rosin electrode exhibits excellent specific capacity as well as remarkable capacity retention in bending tests.

In a WMN, wireless routers provide multi-hop wireless connectivity between hosts in the network and also allow them to access the Internet via gateway devices. Wireless routers are typically equipped with multiple radios operating on different channels to increase network throughput. Multicast is a form of communication that delivers data from a source to a set of destinations simultaneously. It is used in a number of applications, such as distributed games, distance education, and video conferencing. In this study, we address a channel assignment problem for multicast in multi-radio multi-channel WMNs. In a multi-radio multi-channel WMN, two nearby nodes will interfere with each other and cause a throughput decrease when they transmit on the same channel. Thus, an important goal for multicast channel assignment is to reduce the interference among networked devices. We have developed a minimum interference channel assignment (MICA) algorithm for multicast that accurately models the interference relationship between pairs of multicast tree nodes using the concept of the interference factor and assigns channels to tree nodes to minimize interference within the multicast tree. Simulation results show that MICA achieves higher throughput and lower end-to-end packet delay compared with an existing channel assignment algorithm named multi-channel multicast (MCM). In addition, MICA achieves much lower throughput variation among the destination nodes than MCM. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Channel assignment; Multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh network; Multicast communication; Wireless mesh network","Combinatorial optimization; Distance education; Forestry; Gateways (computer networks); Mesh generation; Mica; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Routers; Signal interference; Silicate minerals; Throughput; Trees (mathematics); Video conferencing; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Channel Assignment; Channel assignment problem; Interference factor; Minimum interference; Multi radio multi channels; Multicast communication; Wireless connectivities; Wireless Mesh networks (WMNs); MESH networking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85004008330

In the method, the reference state that satisfies the given torque and rotor flux requirements is derived. Cost indices for the FCS-MPC are defined using the state tracking error, and a linear matrix inequality is formulated to obtain a proper weighting matrix for the state tracking error. The on-line procedure of the proposed FCS-MPC comprises of two steps: select the output voltage vector of the two level inverter minimizing the cost index and compute the optimal modulation factor of the minimizing output voltage vector in order to reduce the state tracking error and torque ripple. The steady state tracking error is removed by using an integrator to adjust the reference state. The simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed FCS-MPC shows good torque, rotor flux control performances at different rotating speeds.

Because it is essential to achieve power sharing between inverters in microgrid, various droop control schemes have been proposed. In practice, the line impedance between inverters and the point of common coupling (PCC) in microgrid are not always equal. This imbalance in line impedance often results in a reactive power mismatch among inverters. This problem has been solved by introducing a virtual impedance loop in the conventional droop control scheme. However, the reactive power sharing performance of this method is still deteriorated when the line impedances change during operation. To overcome such a problem, a new control scheme that is based on a virtual impedance loop and an impedance estimation scheme is proposed. To monitor the changes in line impedances, the impedance estimator is implemented by using the output voltages and currents of inverters as well as the voltages at the PCC. To compensate for the reactive power mismatch due to the line impedance changes, the estimated line impedance is fed to the virtual impedance loop in which it adjusts the virtual impedance value. Comparative simulation results with the conventional ones verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive virtual impedance based droop control scheme. © 2016, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The proposed HPW has novel mechanical and control features compared with conventional powered wheelchairs. An ergonomic back-braking mechanism was designed in order to stop the wheels easily. In terms of control features, the HPW remarkably reduces the muscle power required by combining various assistive functions, such as wheel torque assistance, friction/inertia compensation, gravity compensation, and the one-hand driving algorithm. For wheel torque assistance, strain gauges were attached to the hand-rim in order to measure the wheel torque applied by a human. Gyroscopes and an accelerometer were attached to the wheel and chair respectively for friction and inertia compensation. An inclinometer was attached for gravity compensation and the one-hand driving algorithm was included for patients who can only use one hand. The one-hand driving algorithm controls the angular velocity of the uncontrolled wheel by using a gyroscope and pressure sensors attached to the bottom of the seat.

A least-square weighted residual method was employed for implicit discretization to solve the level set advection equation. By contrast, a direct re-initialization method, which is directly applicable to the local level set method for unstructured meshes, was adopted to re-correct the level set function to become a signed distance function after advection. The proposed algorithm was constructed such that the advection and direct reinitialization steps were conducted only for nodes inside the narrow band around the interface. Therefore, in the advection step, the Gauss–Seidel method was used to update the level set function using a node-by-node solution method.

In IoT environments, various device information is collected from the user for intelligent technologies and services that control the devices. Recently, wireless sensor networks based on IoT environments are being used in sectors as diverse as medicine, the military, and commerce. Specifically, sensor techniques that collect relevant area data via mini-sensors after distributing smart dust in inaccessible areas like forests or military zones have been embraced as the future of information technology. IoT environments that utilize smart dust are composed of the sensor nodes that detect data using wireless sensors and transmit the detected data to middle nodes. Currently, since the sensors used in these environments are composed of mini-hardware, they have limited memory, processing power, and energy, and a variety of research that aims to make the best use of these limited resources is progressing. This paper proposes a method to utilize these resources while considering energy efficiency, and suggests lightweight mutual verification and key exchange methods based on a hash function that has no restrictions on operation quantity, velocity, and storage space.

Sparse inverse covariance learning of linear Gaussian conditional models has been recently studied, shown to achieve superb prediction performance. However, it can fail when the underlying true input–output process is non-Gaussian and/or non-linear. We introduce a novel sparse conditional copula model to represent the joint density of the output variables. By incorporating a Gaussian copula function, yet modeling univariate marginal densities by (non-Gaussian) mixtures of experts, we achieve high flexibility in representation that admits non-linear and non-Gaussian densities. We then propose a sparse learning method for this copula-based model that effectively imposes sparsity in the conditional dependency among output variables. The learning optimization is efficient as it can be decomposed into gradient-descent marginal density estimation and the sparse inverse covariance learning for the copula function. Improved performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on several interesting image/vision tasks with high dimensions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Copula models; Gaussian random fields; Multiple output regression; Sparse inverse covariance estimation","Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Inverse problems; Probability density function; Regression analysis; Copula models; Gaussian random fields; Inverse covariance; Learning optimizations; Mixtures of experts; Multiple outputs; Non-Gaussian densities; Prediction performance; Distribution functions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994888062

However, the method has some drawbacks, including instability, the nonsmooth nature of the decision boundary, and the possibility of overfitting. To overcome these problems, several works have utilized the relative advantages of other classifiers, such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and neural networks, in combination with a decision tree, in hybrid models which avoid the drawbacks of other models. Some hybrid models have used decision trees to quickly and efficiently partition the input space, and many studies have proved the effectiveness of the hybrid methods. However, there is room for further improvement by considering the topological properties of a dataset, because typical decision trees split nodes based only on the target variable. The proposed semi-supervised decision tree splits internal nodes by utilizing both labels and the structural characteristics of data for subspace partitioning, to improve the accuracy of classifiers applied to terminal nodes in the hybrid models. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the detailed characteristics of the algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Decision tree; Inhomogeneous measure; Semi-supervised decision tree; Subspace partitioning","Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Logistic regression; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Topology; Vectors; Classification models; Decision boundary; Hybrid classification; Inhomogeneous measure; Semi-supervised; Structural characteristics; Subspace partitioning; Topological properties; Trees (mathematics)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994805867

In this study, monthly sampling campaigns were conducted from a reservoir (Daecheong Reservoir, South Korea) and its forested tributaries for five consecutive months (June to October) to examine the variations of DOM composition. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) was applied to track the variations of different fluorescent components within bulk DOM. Selected samples were further separated into hydrophobic (Ho) and hydrophilic (Hi) fractions. Water quality and DOM composition varied greatly with the sampling locations including the upstream and the downstream tributary sites, and the reservoir. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) provided the information on the DOM sources and the potential processes leading to the observed DOM changes. Four of the five fluorescent components, identified by EEM-PARAFAC, were well correlated with the flow rates of the tributaries, suggesting hydrological control on DOM composition. The greatest effects were found on two terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C2). The Ho fraction of DOM was more abundant for the post-storm samples versus the non-storm samples, supporting the important roles of hydrology on the changes in chemical composition of DOM. The amounts of the DOM resin fractions, either Ho or Hi, showed strong relationships with C1 and C2, suggesting that DOM fluorescence could be successfully applied to estimate different DOM chemical constituents in forested watersheds. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Flow rate; Fluorescence; Hydrology; Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC); Resin fractionation","chemical composition; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; factor analysis; flow pattern; fluorescence spectroscopy; fractionation; hydrology; reservoir; resin; seasonal variation; storm; tributary; water chemistry; water quality; watershed; Daecheong Dam; South Korea; Taejon [South Korea]; organic compound; chemistry; forest; river; season; South Korea; water quality; water supply; weather; Forests; Organic Chemicals; Republic of Korea; Rivers; Seasons; Water Quality; Water Supply; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988731010

Therefore, this paper describes an attempt to measure the public value, applying the contingent valuation (CV) method. To this end, we conducted a CV survey of 1000 households in Korea in 2015. We used a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question to derive the willingness to pay (WTP) responses, and utilized a spike model to analyze zero WTP responses. The mean WTP was computed to be KRW 1627 (USD 1.37) per household per year and statistically meaningful at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 30.4 billion (USD 25.7 million) per year. The present value of the total public value for the next ten years reaches KRW 241.7 billion (USD 204.0 million), using a social discount rate of 5.5%.

Methods: ZnO with the smallest particle size showed relatively high anti-microbial activity by disc diffusion assay and broth macrodilution assay. The mixtures of ZnO and CA also showed relatively high anti-microbial activity when the particle size of ZnO was the smallest. Furthermore, anti-microbial activities of ZnO, CA and the mixtures of ZnO and CA were compared through the checkerboard assay. Results: The results indicated that a 1 : 1 ratio of ZnO and CA resulted in the highest anti-microbial activity. The substances were confirmed to have synergic anti-microbial effects. With the time-kill curve assay, the mixture of ZnO-containing CA reduced the surviving microbial content the most after 24 h.

The proposed converter is based on isolated conventional single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) PFC converter. The conduction loss of rectification is reduced than a conventional one because the proposed converter is designed to eliminate a full-bridge rectifier at an input stage. Moreover, for zero-current switching (ZCS) operation and low voltage stresses of output diodes, the secondary of the proposed converter is designed as voltage doubler with a LC resonant tank. Additionally, an input–output electrical isolation is provided for safety standard. In conclusion, high power factor is achieved and efficiency is improved. The operational principles, steady-state analysis and design equations of the proposed converter are described in detail. Experimental results from a 60 W prototype at a constant switching frequency 100 kHz are presented to verify the performance of the proposed converter. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bridgeless converter; power factor correction; resonant converter; zero-current switching","Electric power factor correction; Power converters; Rectifying circuits; Zero current switching; Bridgeless converters; Constant switching frequency; Operational principles; Power factor corrections; Resonant converters; Single ended primary inductance converters (SEPIC); Steady-state analysis; Voltage doubler rectifier; Electric rectifiers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964681391

An IoT operates through interaction among many composition elements, such as actuators and sensors. At present, IoTs are used in diverse areas (for example, traffic control and safety, energy savings, process control, communications systems, distributed robots, and other important applications). In daily life, IoTs should provide services of high reliability corresponding with various physical elements. In order to guarantee highly reliable IoT services, optimized modeling, simulation, and resource management technologies integrating physical elements and computing elements are required. For such reasons, many systems are being developed where autonomic computing technologies are applied that sense any internal errors or external environmental changes occurring during system operation and where systems adapt or evolve themselves. In an IoT environment composed of large-scale nodes, autonomic computing requires a high processing amount and efficient storage processing of computing in order to process sensing data efficiently. In addition, due to the heterogeneous composition of IoT environments, separate middleware is required to share collected information. Accordingly, this paper proposed an efficient resource management scheme (ERMS) that efficiently manages IoT resources using cloud infrastructure satisfying the high availability, expansion, and high processing amount requirements. ERMS provides a XML-based standard sensing data storage scheme in order to store and process heterogeneous IoT sensing data in the cloud infrastructure. In addition, ERMS provides classification techniques to efficiently store and process distributed IoT data. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Internet of Things (IoT); QoS; Resource cassification; Resource management","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Environmental technology; Internet; Middleware; Natural resources management; Process control; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Classification technique; Cloud infrastructures; Communications systems; Heterogeneous composition; Internet of Things (IOT); Resource cassification; Resource management; Resource management schemes; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944931146

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method for obtaining an all-in-focus (AIF) color image from a database of color and depth image pairs. Since the defocus blur is inherently depth-dependent, the color pixels are first grouped according to their depth values. The defocus blur parameters are then estimated using the amount of the defocus blur of the grouped pixels. Given a defocused color image and its estimated blur parameters, the AIF image is produced by adopting the conventional pixel-wise mapping technique. In addition, the availability of the depth image disambiguates the objects located far or near from the in-focus object and thus facilitates image refocusing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using both synthetic and real color and depth images. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","All-in-focus; Defocus blur; Depth image; Image refocus; Multi-focus","Algorithms; Computer vision; Image reconstruction; Parameter estimation; Pixels; Color and depth images; Color image reconstruction; Computer vision algorithms; Defocus blur; Depth image; Image refocus; Multi-focus; Registered color images; Color",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924151461

For smart multimedia devices, it provides convenient use of time and space for many people by replacing many desktop PC functions. Although this convenience has gained popularity among the public, the security is usually neglected. In addition, the miniaturization of smart devices provides easy portability, but it also leads to more chances of being lost or stolen. Inherent features are generalized, but the features also increase risk of exposing personal information. As a result, smart multimedia devices provide a variety of locking features to protect personal information. The features include simple hiding of the screen, password buttons, and pattern locks. Although password and pattern lock features exhibit some degree of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing or smudging. In this paper, vulnerable security points of smart multimedia devices are complemented and the locking system for enhanced security (LSES), in which intuitive user interface provides convenience, is proposed.

In MIMO systems, channel state information (CSI) is typically required at the receiver to detect transmitted signals; however, in practical systems, the CSI is imperfect and contains errors, which affect the overall system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel maximum likelihood (ML) scheme for MIMO systems that is robust to the CSI errors. We apply an optimization method to estimate an instantaneous covariance matrix of the CSI errors in order to improve the detection performance. Furthermore, we propose the employment of the list sphere decoding (LSD) scheme to reduce the computational complexity, which is capable of efficiently finding a reduced set of the candidate symbol vectors for the computation of the covariance matrix of the CSI errors. An iterative detection scheme is also proposed to further improve the detection performance. © 2016 KSII.","Channel estimation error; Channel state information; List sphere decoding; Maximum likelihood detection; MIMO","Channel estimation; Communication channels (information theory); Covariance matrix; Decoding; Errors; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; MIMO systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Channel estimation errors; Detection performance; Iterative detection; List sphere decoding; Maximum likelihood detection; Optimization method; Transmitted signal; Wireless communications; Channel state information",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989899078

To reduce the size of the system for wearable applications, the transmitter and receiver are designed and fabricated on a flat plane of fabric. A proposed symmetric four-resonator MR-WPT system is used for verifying the electromagnetic property of the textile substrates. Two textile substrates: polyester and cotton fibre are investigated to determine their impact on the transfer efficiency. Experiments show that the transfer efficiency is considerably higher with the polyester substrate than with the cotton substrate. In addition, copper tape and silver paste are employed for the resonator fabrication because of their flexibility. The measured results show that the copper tape has a significantly higher transfer efficiency than the silver paste because of its high conductivity. At a transfer distance of 5 cm, the maximum transfer efficiency is 50% with the polyester substrate and the copper tape resonator. Furthermore, the width of the coil-pattern is varied to determine its impact on the resonant frequency and the transfer efficiency of the MR-WPT system.

Among the key features that affect the cyclability, the shuttling process involving polysulfides (PS) dissolution is most fatal. In an effort to suppress this chronic PS shuttling, herein, a separator coated with poled BaTiO3 or BTO particles is introduced. Permanent dipoles that are formed in the BTO particles upon the application of an electric field can effectively reject PS from passing through the separator via electrostatic repulsion, resulting in significantly improved cyclability, even when a simple mixture of elemental sulfur and conductive carbon is used as a sulfur cathode. The coating of BTO particles also considerably suppresses thermal shrinkage of the poly(ethylene) separator at high temperatures and thus enhances the safety of the cell adopting the given separator. The incorporation of poled particles can be universally applied to a wide range of rechargeable batteries (i.e., metal-air batteries) that suffer from cross-contamination of charged species between both electrodes. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The presence of highly dispersed ALD Ru islands over a porous Ni mesh was confirmed, and the Ni/ALD Ru anode microstructure was observed. Fuel cell tests were conducted using Ni-only and Ni/ALD Ru anodes with approximately 350 μm thick gadolinium-doped ceria electrolytes and platinum cathodes. The performance of fuel cells was assessed using pure methanol at operating temperatures of 300-400 °C. Micromorphological changes of the anode after cell operation were investigated, and the content of adsorbed carbon on the anode side of the operated samples was measured. The difference in the maximum power density between samples utilizing Ni/ALD Ru and Pt/ALD Ru, the latter being the best catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells, was observed to be less than 7% at 300 °C and 30% at 350 °C. The improved electrochemical activity of the Ni/ALD Ru anode compared to that of the Ni-only anode, along with the reduction of the number of catalytically active sites due to agglomeration of Ni and carbon formation on the Ni surface as compared to Pt, explains this decent performance. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","atomic layer deposition; direct methanol solid oxide fuel cell; heterogeneous catalysts; nickel; ruthenium","Anodes; Atomic layer deposition; Atoms; Catalysts; Deposition; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Electrodes; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Nickel; Platinum; Ruthenium; Temperature; Anode microstructures; Bimetallic catalysts; Direct methanol; Electrochemical activities; Gadolinium doped ceria; Heterogeneous catalyst; Maximum power density; Operating temperature; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994805486

In spite of these considerable benefits and ongoing progress in the field, momentous challenges exist, related with structural disintegration due to volume expansion of electrode materials. This leads to rapid capacity decline and must be resolved in order to progress for realistic utilization of LIBs with ultrafast cycling stability. This article proposes a novel architecture of Sb-doped SnO2 nanoparticles sandwiched between carbon nanofiber and carbon skin (CNF/ATO/C) using electrospinning and hydrothermal methods. The CNF/ATO/C exhibits superb electrochemical behavior such as high specific capacity and outstanding cycling stability (705 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles), outstanding high-rate performance (411 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1), and ultrafast cycling stability (347 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 after 100 cycles), which is high compared to any reported value using SnO2-based anode materials. Thus, this unique architecture furnishes profitable effects, including electroactive sites, structural stability, and electrical conductivity, which can potentially be realizes for ultrafast LIBs. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","anode; antimony-doped tin oxide; carbon skin; Li-ion battery; sandwich structure","Carbon nanofibers; Electrodes; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Nanoparticles; Sandwich structures; Stability; Tin; Tin oxides; Antimony-doped tin oxide; Antimony-doped tin oxide nanoparticles; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical behaviors; High specific capacity; High-rate performance; Potential technologies; Structural stabilities; Anodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994750624

Through FE analyses, various process parameters, such as the horizontal and vertical die gap and the rolling stroke, were investigated in terms of the forming accuracy. The material flow characteristics in the thread rolling process of the symmetric and asymmetric screws were also discussed, and the relevant process parameters were determined accordingly.

The proposed algorithm can reduce the table size to half, compared to the radix-22 algorithm, while retaining the simple structure. In addition, a new dynamic data scaling approach is presented to reduce hardware complexity without degrading signal-to- quantization-noise ratio (SQNR).

Therefore, developing a single-step molding method such as injection molding by using plastics containing aluminum (Al) flake (i.e. two-dimensional flat plate) that imparts metallic textures to plastic products is beneficial. Unlike one-dimensional fillers, such as fibers, two-dimensional fillers exhibit complex orientation during molding. In this paper, the orientation of two-dimensional fillers was analyzed, and their surface appearances during the injection molding of various shapes, such as holes, slits and ribs, were predicted. During normal flow, the Al flakes oriented parallel to the flow direction near the skin region of the product, whereas those near the core region and the weldline oriented perpendicular to the flow direction or flow direction. Al flake orientations at the bottom surface of ribs were irregular, causing flow marks. These predicted surface appearances were compared with those of actual injection molded product, and the simulations showed good agreement with the experimental results. © 2016 The Polymer Society of Korea.

This analysis improves, by one order, the previous extraction of the b-quark fragmentation function. We find that while the addition of the next order in the calculation does not much shift the extracted form of the fragmentation function, it does reduce theoretical errors indicating that the expansion is converging. Using an approach based on effective field theory allows us to systematically control theoretical errors. While the fits of theory to data are generally good, the fits seem to be hinting that higher order correction from HQET may be needed to explain the b-quark fragmentation function at smaller values of momentum fraction. © 2016, The Author(s).","QCD Phenomenology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996993160

The practical use of such functional microfluidic systems requires rapid and uniform fluid displacement throughout the channel network with minimal amount of liquid supply. The goal of this simulation study is to design various microfluidic networks for similar applications including, but not limited to, the color-switching windows and compare the liquid displacement speed and efficiency of the designs. We numerically simulate and analyze the liquid displacement in the microfluidic networks with serpentine, parallel and lattice channel configurations, as well as their modified versions with wide or tapered distributor and collector channels. The data are analyzed on the basis of numerical criteria defined to evaluate the performance of the corresponding functional systems. We found that the lattice channel network geometry with the tapered distributors and collectors provides most rapid and uniform fluid displacement with minimum liquid waste. The simulation results could give an important guideline for efficient liquid supply/displacement in emerging functional systems with embedded microfluidic networks.

Recently, the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm has been successfully applied to outlier detection. However, due to the computational complexity of the LOF algorithm, its application to large data with high dimension has been limited. The aim of this paper is to propose grid-based algorithm that reduces the computation time required by the LOF algorithm to determine the k-nearest neighbors. The algorithm divides the data spaces in to a smaller number of regions, called as a ""grid"", and calculates the LOF value of each grid. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, several experiments incorporating different parameters were conducted. The proposed method demonstrated a significant computation time reduction with predictable and acceptable trade-off errors. Then, the proposed methodology was successfully applied to real database transaction logs of Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute. As a result, we show that for a very large dataset, the grid-LOF can be considered as an acceptable approximation for the original LOF. Moreover, it can also be effectively used for real-time outlier detection. © 2016 Lee, Cho.

Here, we investigated the protective effects of TES trioleate on cell damage caused by ultraviolet A (UVA) light and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-incubation with 250–1000 μM TES trioleate resulted in concentration-dependent protection from UVA-induced damage in HaCaT cells. Additionally, 25–1000 μM TES trioleate provided protection against H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In human red blood cells treated with 1O2, 10–100 μM TES trioleate showed concentration-dependent protective effects, similar to but stronger than the controls, 4-BPB and lipophilic antioxidant (+)-α-tocopherol at 1000 μM. TES trioleate did not have detectable radical scavenging activity. Moreover, compared with (+)-α-tocopherol and rutin, TES trioleate showed low ROS scavenging activity. Thus, although TES trioleate showed cell protective effects against UVA, H2O2, and 1O2-induced damage, these effects were not caused by the scavenging ability of the radical or ROS. Finally, pretreatment of HaCaT cells and human erythrocytes with L-α-lysophosphatidylcholine produced by PLA2 promoted increased cell damage at low concentrations.

This paper attempts to analyze the economic impacts of four transportation modes using input-output (I-O) analysis, with specific application to Korea. To this end, we apply the I-O models to the Korean I-O tables generated by the Bank of Korea, paying particular attention to the four transportation sectors in Korea (rail, road, water, and air transportations), considering them as exogenous, and then determining their impacts. Specifically, the production-inducing effects, supply shortage effects, sectoral price effects, forward linkage effects, and backward linkage effects of the four transportation modes are quantitatively derived over the period 2000–2010. For example, the production-inducing effect of a KRW 1.0 production or investment in transportation is larger in the petroleum and transportation equipment sectors than in other sectors. Furthermore, the rail and road transportation sectors have greater supply shortage effects than the other transportation sectors. Finally, the potential uses of the results of this analysis are presented from the perspective of policy instruments, and policy implications are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Exogenous specification; Input-output analysis; Korea; Transportation sector","Economic and social effects; Economics; Motor transportation; Petroleum transportation; Public policy; Roads and streets; Exogenous specification; Input output analysis; Korea; Road transportation; Transportation equipments; Transportation industry; Transportation mode; Transportation sector; Petroleum industry; banking; economic development; economic impact; input-output analysis; national economy; transportation economics; transportation mode; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983783205

To extract the accurate motion information, multi-scale histogram optical flow (MHOF) can be obtained through OF. We combine MHOF and SI into the spatiotemporal features of video frames.

After conducting the detail survey, a simulation environment for SCADA water pumping system is designed in-which number of nodes is configured and well known cryptography algorithms are selected, and deployed as an inclusive development for SCADA/DNP3 broadcasting system. The inclusive security development is considered with the best performance, and with predominant weakness in mind, which are present in SCADA/DNP3 broadcasting system. However, overall communication is initiated, monitored and controlled at main controller side with the user defined human machine interface (HMI). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cryptography dynamic buffer; Cryptography mechanisms; Distributed network protocol; SCADA Broadcasting system; Supervisory control and data acquisition","Cryptography; Data acquisition; Multicasting; Network protocols; SCADA systems; Broadcasting systems; Cryptography algorithms; Distributed network protocols; Human Machine Interface; Security mechanism; Simulation environment; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Water pumping systems; Broadcasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947794119

Thus, the Korean Government is considering the introduction of a BG mandate, in which the legal blend is 2% BG and 98% conventional gas (BG2), by 2020 to expand BG use. We should examine the public acceptability of the introduction, which will incur a rise in the gas price. This study attempts to assess the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for introducing the BG2 program in Korea. The WTP data were obtained from a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey of 1000 households. Because a considerable number of the respondents (63.4%) gave a zero WTP response, we applied a spike model to treat the WTP data with zero observations. The yearly mean WTP was computed as 2539 Korean won (KRW) (USD 2.5) per household for the next 10 years, which is also statistically meaningful at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 50.7 billion (USD 49.5 million) per year. The present value of the total public WTP amounts to KRW372.7 billion (USD 368.4 million) using a social discount rate of 5.5%. We can conclude that gas consumers in Korea are ready to shoulder some of the financial burden of expanding the use of BG.. © 2016 by the authors.","Biogas; Contingent valuation; Public acceptability; Spike model; Willingness to pay","biogas; contingent valuation; discount rate; emission control; energy market; environmental modeling; governance approach; greenhouse gas; public service; willingness to pay; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000399187

However, they can be a valuable tool when implemented in a controlled way. Here, we introduce a strategy to control the crack propagation of mesoporous micropatterns (prisms and pyramids), which leads to the isolation of well-defined microstructures. Mesoporous micropatterns were fabricated by the soft imprinting technique with wet TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) pastes, followed by sintering to remove organic components. Since the volume of the paste significantly shrinks during the sintering step, stress is localized at the edge of micropatterns, in good agreement with finite element method simulations, creating well-defined cracks and their propagation. It was demonstrated that the degree of stress localization is determined by the thickness of residual layers, NP size, and heating rate. After controlled crack propagation and delamination of microparticles from the substrates, mesoporous microwires and microparticles were successfully produced and functionalized from the isolated mesoporous prisms and pyramids. The method proposed in this study for controlled crack manipulation and delamination opens a door for straightforward and economical fabrication of well-defined mesoporous microparticles. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","crack manipulation; delamination; mesoporous prism(s); mesoporous pyramid(s); soft lithography; stress localization","Crack propagation; Cracks; Delamination; Finite element method; Lithography; Mesoporous materials; Microstructure; Prisms; Sintering; Economical fabrication; Finite element method simulation; Imprinting technique; Mesoporous; Organic components; Residual layers; Soft lithography; Stress localization; Failure (mechanical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994005698

A single access point (AP) of 802.11ah can provide connectivity to a large number of devices (up to 8192) with the communication range of up to 1 km. Due to such a large coverage area with a large number of connected devices, however, the hidden node problem of 802.11ah networks is severer than typical Wi-Fi networks. Especially, we observe that frequent occurrences of a collision chain results in significant deterioration of network performance even with the group-based access restriction mechanism of 802.11ah. To solve this problem, we propose a collision chain mitigation scheme that detects and interrupts a collision chain, lets a smaller number of devices contend thereafter and also provide the information from which a carrier-sensitivity table is constructed by AP. Although the proposed scheme mitigates performance deterioration due to a collision chain when occurred, collision chains still occur. So, we propose a grouping algorithm which can perform both initial grouping and regrouping from existing groups based on the carrier-sensitivity table constructed by the mitigation scheme so that only a negligible number of hidden devices remain in each group and the root cause of collision chain is obviated. Our simulation study shows that the mitigation scheme alone makes network throughput comparable to the case of no hidden devices and its combination with the grouping algorithm improves throughput performance over the 8-group case of the conventional mechanism by up to 146%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Collision; Grouping algorithm; Hidden node problem; IEEE 802.11ah","Deterioration; Problem solving; Wi-Fi; Collision; Grouping algorithm; Hidden node problems; IEEE 802.11ah; Performance deterioration; Significant deteriorations; Throughput performance; Wireless connectivities; Chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987896345

The nanostructure of composites as a channel and a sensing material plays a critical role in the performance of field effect transistors (FETs). Therefore, it is highly desirable to prepare elaborate composite that can allow the fabrication of high performance FETs and also provide high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting specific chemical/biological targets. In this work, we demonstrate that high performance FETs can be fabricated with a hydrodynamically assembled composite, a semiconducting nanomesh, of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (S-SWNTs) and a genetically engineered M13 phage to show strong binding affinity toward SWNTs. The semiconducting nanomesh enables a high on/off ratio (∼10 4) of FETs. We also show that the threshold voltage and the channel current of the nanomesh FETs are sensitive to the change of the M13 phage surface charge. This biological gate effect of the phage enables the detection of biologically important molecules such as dopamine and bisphenol A using nanomesh-based FETs.

The S-parameter-based formula is widely used to obtain the antenna correlation coefficient, instead of the original 3D-radiation-pattern-based one, to ease the measurement and calculation process. This method assumes the MIMO antennas are highly efficient, thus not suitable for a lossy MIMO antenna array built in compact handset devices. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improved S-parameter-based method including antenna's embedded and non-coupled radiation efficiencies. Using these efficiencies, the lossless S-parameters of an antenna network can be obtained and used to calculate the antenna correlation coefficient of lossy MIMO arrays. The proposed method is examined by full-wave simulation data of closely spaced printed dipole antennas with different loss factors. The results show that a more accurate estimation of the antenna correlation coefficient can be carried out compared to conventional S-parameter-based methods. © 2016 IEEE.","antenna correlation; antenna impedance; embedded radiation efficiency; MIMO antenna; mutual coupling; scattering parameter","Antenna arrays; Dipole antennas; Efficiency; Microstrip antennas; Mobile antennas; Parameter estimation; Scattering parameters; Antenna correlation; Antenna impedance; MIMO antenna; Mutual coupling; Radiation efficiency; Directional patterns (antenna)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995486198

According to the analysis of measurement results, the muscle-mimicking leads blocking on the H-field of MR-WPT system. This phenomenon has an affect the decreasing transfer efficiency that could be explained by the change in resonant frequency of the receiver resonator due to the impact of the dielectric constant and the conductivity of the MML liquid.

The k-clique detection problem as one of the fundamental problems in computer science, can assist us to understand the organization style and behavioral patterns of users in social networks. However, real social networks usually evolve over time and it remains a challenge to efficiently detect the k-cliques from dynamic social networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient k-clique dynamic detection theorem based on triadic formal concept analysis (TFCA) with completed mathematical proof. With this proposed detection theorem, we prove that the k-cliques detection problem is equivalent to finding the explicit k-cliques generated from k-triadic equiconcepts plus the implicit k-cliques derived from its high-order triadic equiconcepts.

Based on the present plastic influence functions, the GE/EPRI-type J-estimation scheme for complex-cracked pipes was suggested, and the results from the proposed J-estimation were compared with the FE results using both R-O fit parameters and actual tensile data of SA376 TP304 stainless steel. The comparison results demonstrate that although the proposed scheme provided sensitive J estimations according to fitting ranges of R-O parameters, it showed overall good agreements with the FE results using R-O relation.

The Ag-grid FTE was fabricated on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate using the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet printing process. We achieved a fine pattern of a line width of 4.6 μm. The Ag-grid FTE exhibited the sheet resistances of ~ 4 Ω/sq. and optical transmittance of around 80% with a pitch of 150 μm. We also used the carbon treated black metal-nanoparticles to lower the haze up to 1%. The effects of the sintering temperature on the microstructure and sheet resistance were investigated. From the sintering temperature of 150 °C, a stable necking between nano-particles began to form, and the sheet resistance substantially decreased. The mechanical flexibility and durability of the Ag-grid FTEs were investigated via bending, stretching, dynamic/static fatigue tests, and adhesion tests. The outward bending test results showed that the Ag-grid FTE can be bent up to 3 mm without failure of the electrode. The stretching test indicated that the Ag-grid FTEs can be stretched to a tensile strain of 9%; however, the Ag-grid was slightly vulnerable at the extreme bending radius in the bending cyclic fatigue tests due to severe strain accumulation. The Ag-grid FTEs exhibited a very stable static bending fatigue property during the 1000 h test as well as an excellent adhesion property. These results indicate that the Ag-grid FTE is a promising electrode scheme for bendable or foldable electronic devices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electrohydrodynamic printing; Electromechanical reliability; Flexible transparent electrode; Metal grid","Adhesion; Bending tests; Carbon; Durability; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; Electronic equipment; Fatigue testing; Fighter aircraft; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Plastic bottles; Printing; Sheet resistance; Sintering; Tensile strain; Thermoelectric equipment; Electrohydrodynamic (EHD); Electrohydrodynamic printings; Flexible electronic devices; Mechanical characteristics; Mechanical flexibility; Metal grid; Sintering temperatures; Transparent electrode; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992561509

The mixed precursors were heated at various temperatures ranging from 450 to 750°C using microwave heating processing. Spinel Li4Ti5O12 prepared from TiO(OH)2 as a Ti precursor exhibits lower synthesis temperature of 550°C than Li4Ti5O12 prepared from TiO2. Two types of spinel Li4Ti5O12 obtained from TiO(OH)2 and TiO2 were characterized using X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, and scanning electron microscopy. Hybrid capacitors to evaluate the electrochemical performance of spinel Li4Ti5O12 were fabricated using activated carbon as a cathode material. TiO(OH)2 has the advantage of low-temperature synthesis in comparison with rutile or anatase phase TiO2, because TiO(OH)2 possesses a high concentration of defects in the structure. As a result, the rate capability of the hybrid capacitor improved with the decreasing particle size of the Li4Ti5O12 prepared from TiO(OH)2 owing to the increasing contact area between electrode and electrolyte, as well as reduced diffusion path of lithium ions. In this study, we demonstrated that the high-rate performance and long-term cycle stability of Li4Ti5O12 obtained from TiO(OH)2 for hybrid capacitors.

However, this type of multichannel encoder could cause a longer latency owing to the variable bitrate and relatively bigger size of the buffers, which results in the same delay as in 3DTV even for a conventional DTV service. On the other hand, systems built based on separate encoders, each of which is optimized for the target service, might not have such latency problems. Nevertheless, there might be a distortion problem in the image and sound at the time of a switchover between two encoders with different output bitrates and group of picture structures. This paper proposes a system that can realize a seamless video service conversion using two different video encoders optimized for each video service. An overall functional description of the video service change control server, which is a main control block for the proposed system, is also provided.

For this estimation, multiple solution candidate vectors are selected based on the distances between the MMSE estimate of the solution and the constellation points, and their a-posteriori probabilities are utilized to execute the estimation of the covariance matrix. To improve the estimation accuracy, the estimated covariance matrix is updated iteratively.

The proposed converter is based on a two-stage bridgeless boost-flyback converter. In the proposed converter, the conduction losses are reduced by removing an input full-bridge diode rectifier. The boost inductor is designed to be operated in the discontinuous-conduction mode for achieving high power factor. In the flyback module, the couple inductor that provides input-output electrical isolation for safety is designed to be operated in the critical-conduction mode for low RMS current and low turn-on switching loss by using valley-switching operation. Because of the lossless snubber circuit, the voltage spike of switch is clamped, and the leakage inductor energy is recycled. The snubber capacitor is used as a dc-bus capacitor, which is divided into two capacitors. In addition, some input power is directly conducted to the output, and the remaining power is stored in dc-bus capacitor. So, low-voltage rating capacitors can be used as the dc-bus capacitor and power transfer efficiency is improved.

However, various sources of uncertainty, such as the determination of evaluation criteria, the assignment of criteria weights and performance values, exist in the application of MCDM methods. In this study, three existing methods were combined to quantify the risk and uncertainties inherent to the process of climate change vulnerability assessment, which is called the TOPSIS-based Robustness-Uncertainty-Sensitivity (RUS) approach. The A1B scenario was used to assess the vulnerability of seven metropolitan cities in South Korea to climate change. Twenty indicators that are closely related to the cause of and deterioration from the flood risk and the resulting damages were selected by two surveys of experts, and the weights of these factors were determined by using the Delphi technique, which can derive the subjective weights. Based on the derived weights, the vulnerability ranking was calculated using the TOPSIS method, one of the most popular MCDM methods. This TOPSIS-based RUS approach was used to analyze the robustness of the vulnerability rankings for the assessed cities, to derive the minimum changed weights of the single and multiple criteria that determine the rank equivalence (or reversal) between any two cities and to check the sensitivities of the performance values to the vulnerability rankings. This study showed the effectiveness of the RUS approach for assessing the vulnerability to climate change, demonstrating the application of flood vulnerability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change vulnerability; Flood; Robustness; RUS approach; Sensitivity; TOPSIS; Uncertainty","Decision making; Floods; Risk assessment; Robustness (control systems); Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Flood vulnerabilities; Multi-criteria decision making; Sensitivity; Sources of uncertainty; TOPSIS; Uncertainty; Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change; climate change; flood damage; metropolitan area; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982131434

Among many techniques for ideation, morphology analysis has been employed as a prevalent method, whose success is critically affected by its dimensions and values. Despite the gravity of determining dimensions and values, previous literature has been simply subject to manual construction by some experts, which leads to significant subjectivity and bias in morphology building. For this reason, an analytic and objective way of morphology building is highly required. In response, this paper suggests a new way of morphology building to enhance creative ideation using WordNet. WordNet is a large lexical database of English, which provides a hierarchical network dictionary of words. WordNet's hierarchical relationship characteristic fits morphology analysis as its nature comes from a hierarchical structure of dimensions and values. The use of WordNet can be an excellent remedy for morphology building by employing two types of relationships: meronym/holonym for dimension construction and hyponym/ hypernym for value construction. Since dimension construction extends the contents of horizontal axis of morphology, it is called horizontal extension. Similarly, value construction extends the contents of vertical axis of morphology, thus it is referred to as vertical extension of morphology. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","creativity; idea generation; innovation; morphology; WordNet","Construction; Innovation; Ontology; Creativity; Hierarchical network; Hierarchical structures; Idea generation; Morphological analysis; Morphology analysis; Vertical extension; Wordnet; Morphology; analytical framework; database; hierarchical system; innovation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979498475

The purposes of this paper are two-fold. The first is to obtain the demand function for DHS-based RH in Korea and investigate the price and income elasticities of the demand employing the quarterly data covering the period 1988–2013. The short-run price and income elasticities are estimated as −0.700 and 0.918, respectively. Moreover, the long-run elasticities are −1.253 and 1.642, respectively. The second purpose is to measure the consumption benefits of DHS-based-RH employing the economic theory that they are the sum of the actual payment and consumer surplus for the consumption. Considering that the average price and estimated consumer surplus of the DHS-based RH use in 2013 are computed to be KRW 87,870 (USD 84.1) and KRW 62,764 (USD 60.1) per Gcal, the consumption benefits of the DHS-based RH are calculated to be KRW 150,634 (USD 144.2) per Gcal. This information can be beneficially utilized to conduct an economic feasibility study for a new DHS project related to RH supply. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption benefit; District heating system; Residential heat","Cost estimating; Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Elasticity; Energy efficiency; Functions; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating equipment; Housing; Consumer surplus; Consumption benefit; Demand function; District heating system; Economic feasibilities; Economic theories; Income elasticities; District heating; carbon emission; demand analysis; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; heating; residential energy; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978906928

To realise such a low profile, a zeroth-order resonator antenna with a periodic array of four unit cells was employed, and its geometry was optimised using a full-wave simulation tool to cover an 8 GHz bandwidth from 76 to 84 GHz. With this, the antenna was capable of radiating in the end-fire direction parallel to the board length despite the short distance between the ground and the radiator. Simulation and measurement results showed that the optimised design had low reflection coefficients and consistent radiation patterns throughout the target bandwidth. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.",,"Antenna arrays; Bandwidth; Directional patterns (antenna); Millimeter waves; Chip-to-chip communications; Full-wave simulations; Low-profile; Low-profile antennas; Millimetre waves; Periodic arrays; Simulations and measurements; Zeroth-order resonator; Microwave antennas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987608241

This study determined that the key factors that have the greatest impact on the water leakage repair materials are the micro-behaviors of cracks, and proposed an artificial-crack-behavior test method for the performance verification of the repair materials. The performance of the 15 kinds of repair materials that are currently being used in the field of water leakage repair was evaluated by applying the proposed test method. The main aim of such a test method is to determine if there is water leakage by injecting water leakage repair materials into a crack behavior test specimen with an artificial 5-mm crack width, applying a 2.5 mm vertical behavior load at 100 cycles, and applying 0.3 N/mm2 constant water pressure. The test results showed that of the 15 kinds of repair materials, only two effectively sealed the crack and thus stopped the water leakage. The findings of this study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed artificial-crack-behavior test method and suggest that it can be used as a performance verification method for checking the responsiveness of the repair materials being used in the field of water leakage repair to the repetitive water leakage behaviors that occur in concrete structures.

To address the sustainability problems, SDN needs to provide greater collaboration and tighter integration with networks, servers, and security teams that will have an impact on how enterprises design, plan, deploy and manage networks. In this paper, we propose FS-OpenSecurity, which is a new and pragmatic security architecture model. It consists of two novel methodologies, Software Defined Orchestrator (SDO) and SQUEAK, which offer a robust and secure architecture. The secure architecture is required for protection from diverse threats. Usually, security administrators need to handle each threat individually. However, handling threats automatically by adapting to the threat landscape is a critical demand. Therefore, the architecture must handle defensive processes automatically that are collaboratively based on intelligent external and internal information. © 2016 by the authors.","FS-OpenSecurity; SDN architecture; Security model","adaptive management; computer simulation; database; demand analysis; future prospect; information technology; policy strategy; science and technology; security threat; software; sustainability; taxonomy; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990987622

The Seoul government plans to transform the JBT into a cultural tourism resource and a historical site. This study attempts to analyze the willingness to pay (WTP) for implementing the transformation, which includes building a new shopping arcade for Buddhist culture and tourism, constructing a museum for the teaching of history and an experience center for Korean traditional culture in the precincts of JBT, and making an open space for domestic and/or foreign visitors. To this end, the study looks into the WTP for the implementation, reporting on a contingent valuation (CV) survey that was conducted with 500 Seoul households. The single-bounded dichotomous choice CV model and a spike model were applied to derive the WTP responses and analyze the WTP data with zero observations, respectively. The mean yearly WTP was computed to be KRW7129 (USD 6.30) per household for the next five years, with the estimate being statistically significant at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the Seoul population gives us KRW25.4 billion (USD 22.5 million) per year. The present value of the total WTP amounts to KRW 114.6 billion (USD 101.3 million) using a social discount rate of 5.5%.

In character recognition, users complete a desired sentence with predetermined character allocation by pushing buttons or using touch typing. Existing character recognition requires pushing many buttons for sentence completion. Smart phones, representative smart devices with diverse built-in sensors, have improved convenience by minimizing the number of pushes required for sentence completion based on application research using the drag function of the touchscreen. Despite the development of many touch interfaces, scarce character recognition schemes exist that account for those with disabilities or for unspecified situations, such as users wearing gloves. This paper proposes the Korean Grapheme Immersive Recognition Scheme (KGIRS), which uses gyro and acceleration sensors and was developed for smart devices with diverse built-in sensors. The KGIRS recognizes user gestures through gyro and acceleration sensors and performs Korean grapheme recognition by mapping a character recognition table. The KGIRS could be an excellent solution for the inconvenience of many existing push-type character input schemes by providing character recognition without restraint, regardless of the user’s condition, even for touch incapability. Moreover, it can be used when general users have trouble typing characters using a push-type scheme. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Gesture; Gyro-accelerometer sensor; Immersive mechanism; Korean grapheme recognition","Character recognition; Fasteners; Gyroscopes; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Touch screens; Acceleration sensors; Accelerometer sensor; Gesture; Immersive; Information and Communication Technologies; Korean grapheme recognition; Minimizing the number of; Sentence completions; Gesture recognition",Article in Press,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984908113

The transmit distance of the beam signal is longer than that of the normal sensor node. The nodes of the network make a tree network when receiving a beam message transmitting from the powerful root node. All sensor nodes in a sink tree network synchronize to the superframe and receive beam messages in each superframe. When there is an event at a node, the node make a temporal route to the sink node and the nodes of the route can use the wireless channel in a privileged access. This scheme controls the backoff number effectively so the data delivery priority is given to the nodes of that route.

This study analyzes the extent to which the recognition of the tax system and economic and demographic characteristics affect public attitudes toward the unification tax and the acceptable burden. The empirical results of the study are as follows. First, we confirm that an individual's perception of the fairness of the tax burden affects people's agreement with the unification tax and the level of an acceptable burden. Therefore, recovering the trust of taxpayers is important for improving the perception of the unification tax. Second, we confirm that when people accept the necessity of the tax burden for items such as welfare expenditure, agreement with the unification tax and the level of an acceptable burden rise. This finding implies that it would be easier to secure unification finances if the government persuaded people of the need to unify. Third, apart from agreement with unification, the effects of individual factors on the level of an acceptable unification tax burden differ. This result shows that despite high psychological support for unification, anti-unification sentiment can be created when the individual burden is materially considered.","Attitude toward unification; Unification tax; Willingness to pay the unification tax",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995695179

The impact toughness of hypoeutectoid steels usually increased as interlamellar spacing or cementite thickness decreased, although the impact toughness was largely associated with pearlite fraction. Based on these results, multiple regression analysis was performed to understand the individual effect of pearlite fraction, interlamellar spacing, and cementite thickness on the impact toughness.

The flow around the ball was laminar, for which the Reynolds number was 300, and both forced and natural convections inside and outside the balls were considered. The simulations revealed that the magnitude of convective heat transfer for the different shapes decreased in the following order: bone, dimple, hole, and sphere.

The impedance spectrum of the battery is calculated based on voltage excitation and current response with the aid of an embedded digital lock in amplifier in a digital signal processor. The measured impedance data are utilized in the application of the complex nonlinear least squares method to extract the battery parameters of the equivalent circuit.

The proposed plastic influence functions are tabulated as a function of the pipe geometries, crack length and strain hardening exponent. In order to provide sufficient confidence for the proposed plastic influence functions, the estimation scheme using the proposed plastic influence functions for J and COD of cracked elbows was validated against FE results using R-O parameters for the SA312 TP316 stainless steel. Moreover, the predicted J and COD for elbows with a TWC in the interface between an elbow and a pipe by the proposed scheme were compared with those for cracked straight pipes to investigate the effect of the elbow geometries on crack behavior of elbows. One important point is that crack behaviors in the interface between an elbow and a straight pipe can be significantly different with those in straight pipes according to pipe thickness, crack length and bend radius of elbows. Thus, the proposed plastic influence functions can be useful to predict accurate J and COD for cracked elbows. © 2016, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Crack opening displacement; Finite element analysis; GE/EPRI method; J-integral; Plastic influence functions","Cracks; Elastoplasticity; Finite element method; Interfaces (materials); Method of moments; Strain hardening; Stress intensity factors; Crack opening displacements; Elastic-plastic finite element analysis; Estimation schemes; Fracture parameter; Influence functions; J integral; Strain-hardening exponent; Through-wall crack; Plastic pipe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988495417

The effects of different wiring technologies, including aluminum wires, copper wires, aluminum ribbons, and copper ribbons, on solder fatigue life were investigated to meet the high power requirement of the IGBT module. The module’s temperature distribution and solder fatigue behavior were investigated through coupled electro-thermo-mechanical analysis based on the finite element method. The ribbons attained a chip junction temperature that was 30° C lower than that attained with conventional round wires. The ribbons also exhibited a lower plastic strain in comparison with the wires. However, the difference in plastic strain and junction temperature among the different ribbon materials was relatively small. The ribbons also exhibited different crack propagation behaviors relative to the wires. For the wires, the cracks initiated at the outmost edge of the solder, whereas for the ribbons, the cracks grew in the solder layer beneath the ribbons. Comparison of fatigue failure areas indicated that ribbon bonding technology could substantially enhance the fatigue life of IGBT modules and be a potential candidate for high power modules. © 2016 KIPE.","Fatigue lifetime; Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT); Numerical analysis; Ribbon; Solder fatigue","Aluminum; Copper; Cracks; Electric power systems; Engines; Finite element method; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Numerical analysis; Plastic deformation; Reconfigurable hardware; Wire; Chip junction temperatures; Crack propagation behavior; Fatigue lifetime; Junction temperatures; Numerical predictions; Ribbon; Solder fatigue; Thermo-mechanical analysis; Fatigue of materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988472522

For the former, a new logic computational process based on the material implication is discussed. It consists of several memristors which play roles of combined logic processor and memory, called stateful logic circuit. In this circuit configuration, the logic process flows primarily along a time dimension, whereas in current von Neumann computers it occurs along a spatial dimension. In the stateful logic computation scheme, the energy required for the data transfer between the logic and memory chips can be saved. The non-volatile memory in this circuit also saves the energy required for the data refresh. Neuromorphic (cognitive) computing refers to a computing paradigm that mimics the human brain. Currently, the neuromorphic or cognitive computing mainly relies on the software emulation of several brain functionalities, such as image and voice recognition utilizing the recently highlighted deep learning algorithm. However, the human brain typically consumes ≈10–20 Watts for selected “human-like” tasks, which can be currently mimicked by a supercomputer with power consumption of several tens of kilo- to megawatts. Therefore, hardware implementation of such brain functionality must be eventually sought for power-efficient computation. Several fundamental ideas for utilizing the memristors and their recent progresses in these regards are reviewed. Finally, material and processing issues are dealt with, which is followed by the conclusion and outlook of the field. These technical improvements will substantially decrease the energy consumption for futuristic information technology. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Properties of the CA-HP-β-CD inclusion complex loaded in EL (CD-EL) as DCEL system were compared to characteristics of conventional liposomes (CL), EL, and CD-CL. Particle size, deformability, entrapment efficiency (EE%), stability, and vesicle morphology were characterized in liposome preparations. In addition, in vitro release and skin permeation were analyzed. We found that including Tego® care 450 reduced vesicle size and increased membrane deformability. The addition of HP-β-CD enhanced CA EE% of liposomes almost 1.6-fold that of liposomes without HP-β-CD. Moreover, CD-EL complex showed better controlled release profiles and higher skin permeability than CL and EL.

The system is used to reduce bit-rates for efficient transmission of multi-view video. The transmit source is partitioned into three layers: a base and two enhancement layers. The base layer contains all views encoded by MVC at a low-quality, while each enhancement layer contains high-quality part of the selected left and right views, respectively. The base layer is more important than the enhancement layers to create 3D perception, albeit of low-quality, and should be more protected than the enhancement layers. In this paper, two-level and three-level hierarchical 64QAM are used to provide unequal error protection (UEP) for the client-driven selective streaming system. First we find the suitable hierarchical values, which is the ratio of the distances in hierarchical 64QAM, for the client-driven selective streaming system. Furthermore, we analyze numerically how the hierarchical 64QAM impacts peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance of fast and slow-motion sequences.

In this study, an approach to control surface wettability is proposed by differentiating surface energy of polycarbonate in specified regions, using a combination of two surface treatments: (i) micropattern replication using selective ultrasonic imprinting and (ii) hydrophobic coating using organic silane. In both treatments, profiled masks were used to reduce surface energy in target regions where semi-hydrophobic polycarbonate surfaces were changed to hydrophobic states. Various combinations of selective ultrasonic imprinting and hydrophobic coating were investigated in terms of changes in surface wettability, by measuring contact angle (CA) behaviors on the developed surfaces. By controlling such changes, the surface wettability of regions on a single polycarbonate surface could be differentiated, allowing semi-hydrophobic (CA 87.8°), hydrophobic (CA 114.8°) and superhydrophobic (CA 155.6°) states to coexist. This high CA difference (>60°) on a single surface was then applied to enhance water-repellent characteristics so that the surface wettability could be controlled effectively. Mechanical durability of the developed hybrid surface was also discussed by investigating its CA behavior after surface abrasion. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Micropattern; Selective wetting; Superhydrophobic surface; Ultrasonic imprinting; Wettability","Coatings; Hydrophobicity; Interfacial energy; Polycarbonates; Surface treatment; Functional surfaces; Hydrophobic coatings; Mechanical durability; Micro pattern; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Surface wettability; Ultrasonic imprintings; Wettability control; Wetting; organofluorine derivative; polycarbonate; silane derivative; trichloro(1h, 1h, 2h, 2h perfluorooctyl)silane; unclassified drug; water; Article; contact angle; durability; film; hydrophobicity; investigative procedures; material coating; mechanics; microtechnology; priority journal; surface property; ultrasonic imprinting; ultrasound; wettability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975139875

This study investigated the fatigue strength of SPR joints in tensile-shear specimens with dissimilar Al-5052 and steel sheets. A structural analysis of the specimen was conducted. For this specimen, the upper steel sheet withstood applied load in a monotonic test and played a major role in the low-cycle region. In the high-cycle region, however, the harder surface of the upper steel sheet reduced the fatigue strength by enhancing fretting crack initiation on the opposite softer aluminium surface. Therefore, the fatigue endurance of the specimen was reduced. The fatigue endurance of a SPR joint with the combination of steel and aluminium sheets was found to be governed by the strength of the lower sheet, which is more vulnerable to the applied loading. Thus, it is desirable to use a stronger metal sheet as the lower sheet with regard to the fatigue performance. Scanning acoustic microscopy was effectively used to reveal and prove the formation and growth of subsurface cracks in SPR joints. The structural stress can predict the fatigue lifetimes of the SPR joint specimens within a factor of three. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Ltd.","crack initiation; fatigue strength; FEM analysis; SPR joint; tensile-shear geometry","Aluminum; Crack initiation; Cracks; Fatigue of materials; Piercing; Riveting; Sheet metal; Steel sheet; Fatigue performance; Fatigue strength; FEM analysis; Lap-shear specimen; Scanning Acoustic Microscopy; Self-piercing riveting; Tensile shear specimen; Tensile shears; Tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959431937

With regard to conventional ZMP controls, many researchers have studied ZMP tracking control strategies using an inverted pendulum model on flat level ground, and they have solved a slow response problem of nonminimum phase systems by using suitable feedforward motions called walking patterns. However, the conventional methods lead to ZMP offset errors in the presence of ground slope change; it is hence necessary to quickly eliminate the ZMP offset errors to realize robust balance control. In this paper, we rapidly eliminate the ZMP offset errors through a DOB using a model inversion for robust balance control in the presence of ground slope change. In particular, a dynamic model that uses the projected center of mass (CoM) position on the ground is additionally used as an output to solve a problem that generates an unstable pole during model inversion. Finally, the proposed control strategy is verified through MATLAB simulations and experiments using a real android leg. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Android robot leg; CoM; disturbance observer; slope-changing ground; ZMP","Errors; MATLAB; Navigation; Control strategies; Conventional methods; Disturbance observer; Inverted pendulum model; Matlab simulations; Non-minimum phase systems; Robot leg; slope-changing ground; Robots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956853761

However, a general approach to make the AgNWs-based electrodes, an overcoating of nanowire dispersion onto a transparent polymer, should make an issue of poor mechanical stability, mainly caused by low adhesion between the nanowires and polymer. In addition, a thin insulating layer of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) formed on the surface of AgNWs deteriorates the conductivity of their network, which means that a post-processing such as high temperature annealing is essentially needed. Here we employed a plasma treatment with an inert gas to remove the residual PVP layer, so that the conductivity could be enhanced without employing any high temperature processing. Interestingly, the optical transmittance in the wavelength near 400 nm was also increased, resulting in more neutral coloration of the electrode. An inverted layer processing made the nanowires to be partially buried at the surface of colorless polyimide (cPI), so that the enhancement of mechanical stability and connectivity with overlying materials were simultaneously achieved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Colorless polyimide; Flexible transparent electrode; Plasma treatment; Silver nanowire; Touch sensor","Capacitive sensors; Electric resistance measurement; Inert gases; Mechanical stability; Nanowires; Plasma applications; Polyimides; Silver; Silver compounds; Solvents; High-temperature annealing; High-temperature processing; Percolation thresholds; Plasma treatment; Polyvinyl pyrrolidone; Silver nanowires; Thin insulating layers; Touch sensors; Transparent electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955437902

Especially, in capillary machine-to-machine (M2M) where wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a key technology for its wireless connectivity, a contention-based medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial to enable numerous M2M devices to concurrently access the channel. This paper presents an analytical model for the slotted directional-CSMA-CA mechanism of 802.15.3c networks under saturated environment. By presenting a multi-class approach of directional-CSMA-CA mechanism to reduce collision occurrences, we support an adaptive back-off exponent of M2M device on the required frame payload size. For the mathematical analysis, the discrete-time Markov chain model is applied with the features of PHY/MAC of millimeter Wave (mm-Wave) network and the effects of directional antennas. In addition, extensive simulations are performed to verify the analytical model. The obtained results of the analytic and simulation show that the collision probability of M2M device is reduced by differentially adapting the contention rate to each M2M device, and the fairness property can be improved because there are remarkable increases of opportunities to transmit short-frame payloads. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Capillary machine-to-machine; directional-CSMA-CA; M2M device; Markov chain; Normalized saturation model","Access control; Analytical models; Antennas; Carrier communication; Carrier sense multiple access; Chains; Markov processes; Medium access control; Millimeter waves; Personal communication systems; Queueing networks; Slot antennas; Telecommunication networks; CSMA-CA; Discrete time Markov chains; M2M device; Machine to machines; Medium access control protocols; Multiple access collisions; Saturation model; Wireless personal area networks; Directive antennas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930532730

Rather, smart-service innovations require new frameworks to integrate the market-pull and technology-push models, which focus on both user-centric considerations and technological developments. However, current streams of research continue to merely suggest a conceptual framework. Therefore, it appears to be difficult to apply this framework into practice, due to a lack of systematic methodologies. In response, this study employs morphological analysis, a powerful tool for the systematic generation of ideas. Since the morphological analysis employs several dimensions for explaining new services and combines them to generate new ideas, it is easy to integrate the different approaches to innovations, such as market pull and technology push.

However, previous research has ignored the functional heterogeneity of service when using innovation tools for new service development. In response, we suggest a hybrid approach to differentiating the method of generating new service ideas. A Kano model is first employed to identify whether functional characteristics are core or peripheral, after which different methods are applied for each function. For core functions, a case-based reasoning approach is used, which focuses on identifying similarity; for peripheral functions, we suggest instead a modified zigzagging approach to identify creative functions. To present the working of proposed approach, we conducted a case study using Appstore application, IreaditNow, and show how to generate alternatives for both core services and peripheral services. © 2015 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925584666

This study attempts to measure the economic value of the national MS in the Korean household sector. Economic theory indicates that the economic value of a service is the area under the demand curve, which is the sum of the actual expenditure and the additional willingness to pay (WTP) for the service. The actual expenditure is well known, but the additional WTP is not. Thus, we assess the additional WTP for the national MS, conducting a contingent valuation survey of 1000 randomly selected households in Korea in 2014. We use a one-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice question to derive the WTP responses and apply a spike model to deal with WTP responses of zero. The mean additional WTP per household is computed as KRW860 (USD 0.75) per month and is statistically significant at the 1% level. Given that the monthly expenditure for the MS is KRW 1459 (USD 1.26) per household as of 2013, the economic value of the national MS is computed as KRW 2319 (USD 2.01) per household per month. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 513.6 billion (USD 444.9 million) per year. © 2016 by the authors.","Contingent valuation; Economic value; Meteorological service; Spike model; Willingness to pay","contingent valuation; cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental modeling; meteorology; numerical model; spatiotemporal analysis; willingness to pay; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990923234

Texture properties and swelling of HA-HEC hydrogels were found to be closely linked to cross-linker concentration and swelling medium. Water in HA-HEC hydrogels was found to exist mostly in the form of free water. The viscoelasticity and the network stabilization of the hydrogels were analysed via rheological studies. The release kinetics of the hydrogel followed Fickian diffusion mechanism. In an in vitro skin penetration study, the system substantially improved the delivery of ILTG into the skin.

Examples of these include Leap motion, which measures finger motions to produce finger-based commands and MYO, which measures arm motions for arm-based commands. However, these types of motion sensors are still too expensive to be utilized for commercial applications. Moreover, multiple motion sensors sometimes need to be utilized concurrently in order to estimate user motions accurately. Thus, either the cost of motion sensors or the number utilized needs to be reduced. This paper proposes a motion framework that estimates unmeasured motions based on Bayesian probability and measured motions, where motions are defined by a set of MYO sensor values. Bayesian probability is calculated in advance by measuring co-related motions and counting the occurrence of these measured co-related motions. As a result, the number of MYOs needed is reduced. In experiments conducted using MYOs, the processes used to calculate Bayesian probability and to estimate unmeasured motions were validated. Comparison of the measured motions with the unmeasured motions showed that the difference between the two types of motions was small, and indicated that the proposed motion estimation framework estimates unmeasured motions with an average error of 0.05, which exhibits a 25 % improvement over the traditional method. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Bayesian probability; Motion sensors; MYO; NUI/NUX","Probability; User interfaces; Authoring tool; Average errors; Bayesian probabilities; Commercial applications; Motion sensors; Multiple motions; Natural user interfaces; NUI/NUX; Motion estimation",Article in Press,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982308383

The nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is combined with a subsequent molecular diffusion step controlled by thermal annealing. The new approach is realized by using nanointerdigitated donor–acceptor structure, consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) nanopillar arrays surrounded by phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester. Subsequent thermal annealing leads to vertically aligned ordered quasi-bulk heterojunctions with hierarchical nanostructure. The changes are studied in nanostructural and electrical properties of the pillar samples using scanning probe microscopy. In addition, grazing-incidence small and wide angle X-ray scattering yield detailed quantitative information on the molecular- to domain-scale nanostructures. The changes in crystal size, chain orientation, and domain composition as a function of thermal anneal temperature and time are obtained. In addition, the conductive scanning force microscopy in quantitative imaging mode, applied to the pillar-based samples for the first time, allows us to establish a clear relationship between nanomorphology, nanoelectrical property, and macroscale device performance. It is believed that the NIL combined with controlled molecular diffusion is a powerful method, which could be easily extended to other materials and processes to realize a whole variety of other hierarchical nanomorphologies. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Thus, we introduce a novel approach where Ru nanofibers consisting of nano-sized grains are used instead of the typical Pt counter electrodes for DSSCs. The Ru nanofibers can be successfully prepared via electrospinning followed by post-calcination and hydrogen reduction. This sequential approach provides a novel nanoarchitecture. This architecture consists of nano-sized grains and a unique network structure, which affords high electrical conductivity. The resultant Ru nanofibers exhibit properties of improved photovoltaic performance: (I) lower charge transfer resistance (12.5 Ω cm− 2), (II) higher short-circuit current density (14.77 mA cm− 2), and (III) higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency (6.23%), which is comparable to a commercial Pt counter electrode. The improved photovoltaic performance of the counter electrode in the DSSC is attributed to the combined effects of small grain size which results in a high number of electrochemical sites, high electrical conductivity that leads to improved electrocatalytic activity, and a unique network structure that allows for rapid electron transfer and rapid diffusion of the electrolyte. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Counter electrode; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electrocatalytic activity; Ruthenium","Charge transfer; Electric conductivity; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Nanofibers; Photovoltaic effects; Platinum; Ruthenium; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Calcination and hydrogen reductions; Charge transfer resistance; Counter electrodes; Electrocatalytic activity; High electrical conductivity; Photovoltaic conversion; Photovoltaic performance; Sequential approach; Dye-sensitized solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976328442

By optimized postcalcination of vanadium-nitride and carbon-nanofiber composites at 400 °C for 30 min, we synthesized a unique architecture electrode with interior void spaces and well-defined pores as well as a uniform carbon layer on the V2O5 nanofiber surface. The optimized C/HPV2O5 electrode postcalcined at 400 °C for 30 min showed improved lithium storage properties with high specific discharge capacities, excellent cycling durability (241 mA h g-1 at 100 cycles), and improved high-rate performance (155 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1), which is the highest performance in comparison with previously reported V2O5-based cathode materials. The improved electrochemical feature is due to the attractive properties of the carbon-encapsulated hollow porous structure: (I) excellent cycling durability with high specific capacity relative to the adoption of carbon encapsulation as a physical buffer layer and the effective accommodation of volume changes due to the hollow porous structure, (II) improved high-rate performance because of a shorter Li-ion diffusion pathway resulting from interior void spaces and well-defined pores at the surface.

Sterile-neutrino dark matter produced only through the DW mechanism can be eliminated based on a combination of X-ray and Lyman-α measurements. The SF mechanism can ameliorate the problem occurring in the case of DW mechanism. The other alternative is the production of sterile neutrinos via the decay of the scalar field. By estimating the average momentum of the sterile neutrino, we investigate whether sterile neutrinos can be warm dark matter or not.

The recently developed derailment theory on a wheelset was applied to this new cross wind derailment formula. Contrary to the conventional formulas, this new derailment formula was derived considering a dynamic derailment coefficient (Q/P) under normal running, the friction coefficient between the wheel and the rail, the wheel load variation, the cross running wind effects, and the cross wind. Using this proposed formula, the derailment pattern and the critical cross wind speed of derailment could be predicted for various cross running wind conditions of two running trains.

Each of participants was asked to respond to the agreeability of 16 emotional expressions after feeling each of material samples. From the factor analysis, three tactile emotional factors, such as factor 1 (smooth/slippery/cold), factor 2 (soft/warm/sticky) and factor 3 (hard), were derived and validated by showing good internal consistency. It is concluded that automobile users mainly feel three kinds of emotions from surface textures of ABS resin-based in-vehicle materials. © 2016 ICIC International.","Emotional design; Emotional dimensions; In-vehicle surface textures; Sense of touch","ABS resins; Automobile drivers; Automobiles; Resins; Styrene; Vehicles; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Emotional design; Emotional dimensions; Emotional expressions; Internal consistency; Resin-based materials; Sense of touch; Vehicle surface; Automobile materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981194101

Integrated chassis control uses electronic stability control and active front steering as actuators. In order to generate the control yaw moment using electronic stability control and active front steering, and to coordinate the relative magnitude of the tyre force generated by active front steering with that generated by electronic stability control, a fast and simple yaw moment distribution procedure is needed. For this purpose, adaptive methods, namely the least-mean-square algorithm, the sign-sign least-mean-squares algorithm and the leaky least-mean-square algorithm, are applied. To coordinate active front steering and electronic stability control in the leaky least-mean-square algorithm, a particular weight set is selected. To check the effectiveness of the adaptive algorithms in integrated chassis control, simulations using the vehicle simulation package CarSim® were carried out. © IMechE 2015.","active front steering; adaptive algorithms; electronic stability control; Integrated chassis control","Adaptive algorithms; Automobile steering equipment; Block codes; Chassis; Least squares approximations; Stability; Active front steering; Adaptive methods; Electronic stability control; Integrated chassis controls; Least mean square algorithms; Least mean squares algorithm; Tyre forces; Vehicle simulation; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978524384

A methodology was developed that allows the user to monitor the current construction status relative to the design and verify the completion of the facility through real-time comparison between the planned process represented by the nD object and the actual image of the construction site sent from an on-site webcam. An active nD CAD system was developed that possesses features such as a comparative simulation between the on-site image and a 4D object to minimize interference between processes and a 5D object that is specialized to the resource mobilization level of the field. A telepresence-based nD CAD system was developed based on this methodology, and the practicality of the system was verified by webcams installed on a bridge construction site.

Then, smaller sized liposomes (L) were coated onto the multilayered liposome.

In EBC tests, performances of EBCs including 150 μm-thick membrane are measured as references, while those of membraneless EBCs are measured depending on parameters like glucose flow rate, glucose concentration, distance between two electrodes and electrolyte pH. With the measurements, how the parameters affect EBC performance and their optimal conditions are determined. Based on that, best maximum power density (MPD) of membraneless EBC is 102 ± 5.1 μW · cm-2 with values of 0.5 cc · min-1 (glucose flow rate), 40 mM (glucose concentration), 1 mm (distance between electrodes) and pH 3. When membrane and membraneless EBCs are compared, MPD of the membraneless EBC that is run at the similar operating condition to EBC including membrane is speculated as about 134 μW · cm-2.",,"carbon nanotube; glucose; glucose oxidase; glutaraldehyde; laccase; oxygen; polyethyleneimine; bioenergy; catalysis; chemistry; electrochemistry; electrode; oxidation reduction reaction; procedures; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Glucose; Glucose Oxidase; Glutaral; Laccase; Nanotubes, Carbon; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Polyethyleneimine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978967753

However, despite considerable efforts and progress made in recent years through the interface engineering based on active electrode materials, relatively little attention has been devoted to address the physical aspects of the interface and interfacial layer between the anode materials layer and the current collector. Here, we propose and successfully grow unique graphene directly on a Cu current collector as an ideal interfacial layer using the modified chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The anode with an engineered graphene interlayer exhibits remarkably improved electrochemical performances, such as large reversible specific capacity (921.4 mAh g-1 at current density of 200 mA g-1), excellent Coulombic efficiency (close to approximately 96%), and superior cycling capacity retention and rate properties compared to the bare Cu. These excellent electrochemical features are discussed in terms of multiple beneficial effects of graphene on interfacial stability and adhesion between the anode and the collector, oxidation or corrosion resistance of the graphene grown Cu current collector, and electrical contact conductance during the charge/discharge process. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","2D interlayer; electrochemical behavior; energy storage; graphene; interface engineering; structural stability","Anodes; Chemical vapor deposition; Corrosion resistance; Electric current collectors; Electrodes; Energy storage; Graphene; Interfaces (materials); Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Stability; 2D interlayer; Active electrode materials; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical performance; Interface engineering; Modified chemical vapor depositions; Reversible specific capacity; Structural stabilities; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978794668

However, little is known about how to design NPs with precise distributions in the target tissues. In particular, understanding NP tumor penetration and accumulation characteristics is crucial to maximizing the therapeutic potential of drug molecules carried by the NPs. In this study, we employed poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, given their well-controlled size (<10 nm) and surface charge, to understand how the physical properties of NPs govern their tumor accumulation and penetration behaviors. We demonstrate for the first time that the size and surface charge of PAMAM dendrimers control their distributions in both a 3D multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model and a separate extracellular matrix (ECM) model, which mimics the tumor microenvironment. Smaller PAMAM dendrimers not only diffused more rapidly in the ECM model but also efficiently penetrated to the MCTS core compared to their larger counterparts. Furthermore, cationic, amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers exhibited the greatest accumulation in MCTS compared to either charge-neutral or anionic dendrimers. Our findings indicate that the size and surface charge of PAMAM dendrimers may tailor their tumor accumulation and penetration behaviors. These results suggest that controlled tumor accumulation and distinct intratumoral distributions can be achieved by simply controlling the size and surface charge of dendrimers, which may also be applicable for other similarly sized NPs. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","multicellular tumor spheroids; nanoparticles; PAMAM; tumor penetration","amine; anion; cation; dendrimer; polyamidoamine; dendrimer; drug carrier; PAMAM Starburst; polyamidoamine; polyamine; Article; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; drug penetration; extracellular matrix; human; human cell; multicellular spheroid; particle size; physical chemistry; priority journal; surface charge; tumor microenvironment; tumor spheroid; chemistry; drug delivery system; KB cell line; MCF-7 cell line; multicellular spheroid; Neoplasms; procedures; tumor cell line; Cations; Cell Line, Tumor; Dendrimers; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; KB Cells; MCF-7 Cells; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Polyamines; Spheroids, Cellular",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979026062

For this purpose, the planar velocity profiles were measured at the 1.75B position by particle image velocimetry. The flow patterns were examined with both a straight and a helical port. Two swirls were observed up to 4 mm valve lift with the straight port and up to 2 mm with the helical one; however, only one swirl was present after these lifts. The flow characteristics changed suddenly between 4 and 5 mm lift in the straight port; on the other hand, the change with lift was gradual with the helical port - the transition points between flow regimes were different with the port shapes. In addition, the centers of the swirls were relatively far from the cylinder center so that the effect of eccentricity may not be negligible at 1.75B, regardless the shape. The eccentricity values with the straight port were especially high - over 0.5 for all lifts. Finally, real velocities were found to be much lower than those predicted by the assumption of ISM evaluation, with the profiles differing qualitatively as well. © 2016 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Eccentricity; Helical Port; Impulse Swirl Meter; PIV; Semi-wedge combustion chamber; Steady flow bench; Straight Port; Swirl; Velocity Profile","Combustion chambers; Engines; Steady flow; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Eccentricity; Helical Port; Straight Port; Swirl; Velocity profiles; Velocity distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982862064

Now it is facing the task to abide by the RPS(Renewable Portfolio Standard) policy after commercial operation. If they fail to supply the necessary REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) mandated by the RPS policy, they are subject to be fined by the government and forced to modify the cost function to reflect the burden. Eventually the company's coal-fired power plant will be forced to reduce generation to maximize profit because the amount of electricity generated by the power plant and the REC obligation is positively correlated.

The control objective is to force the inverter currents to follow their references with robustness even under external disturbances in grid voltages. The proposed scheme is realized by a disturbance observer (DOB) based current control scheme. Since the uncertainty in a system can be effectively canceled out using an estimated disturbance by the DOB, the resultant system behaves like a closed-loop system consisting of a disturbance-free nominal model. For experimental verification, a 2 kVA laboratory prototype of a grid connected inverter has been built using a digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F28335.

However, the development of hybrid tractors for better traction performance does not show greatly improved fuel consumption compared to conventional tractors, meaning that different means of controlling- the power source is needed for hybrid tractors. In this study, improving fuel consumption in a parallel hybrid tractor is demonstrated through power split ratio strategy after devising a simulation model of a power train. Initially, the simulation of the power train in a parallel hybrid tractor needs to assess the following actual traction performance factors: the engine, the wheels, and the PTO speed. PTO is the abbreviation of Power Take Off, which is any of several methods for taking power from a power source.

It is known that main market adopters, also called the majority, begin to enter the market after a certain period, based on their levels of price sensitivity, which differ from those of early market adopters. This paper proposes a new dual market model that explicitly considers the delayed entry of the majority. We empirically estimate the delayed entry time (DET) for various consumer electronic products, comparing them with two other related phenomena of the early stages of diffusion: take-off and saddle. We also examine whether the DET of a new product can be predicted before it is reached. The result shows that the DET is predictable, using the coefficients of external and internal influence of the early market, also using those of the single market estimated from limited early data. The findings are managerially helpful because being aware of DET at an early stage enables managers to make timely decisions for serving the mass market. © The Authors 2014.

The phase current reconstruction process, in which the sampled dc-link current from a dc-link current sensor is used to reconstruct the phase currents, is comprehensively investigated, taking account of both the region of duty ratio and the operating mode of the continuous current mode (CCM) and discontinuous current mode (DCM). DCM operation reveals that the phase current reconstruction cannot coincide with the average value of the respective phase current. Eventually, it is confirmed that this proposed balance control based on a circular chain control makes it possible to establish an exact current sharing among the phase currents all over the operating condition including the DCM. The actual phase currents do not show any distorted waveforms due to the multisamplings of dc-link current that do not provoke any extra switching of the converter switches at all. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed phase current-balance control are illustrated through the experimental results. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery charger; circular chain control; Dc link current sensor; DCM operation; multi-phase converters; phase current balancing","Chains; Battery chargers; Dc link currents; DCM operation; Multiphase converters; Phase currents; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976439835

Therefore, this study proposed the fused lasso penalty function to detect the change point of AMP which can be generally fitted by using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution in South Korea. First, four numerical experiments are conducted to compare the detection performances between BCPA and fused lasso method. As a result, fused lasso shows the superiority of the data generated by GEV distribution having skewness. The fused lasso method is applied to 63 weather stations in South Korea and then 17 stations having any change points from BCPA and the GEV fused lasso are analyzed. Similar to the numerical analyses, the GEV fused lasso method can delicately detect the change point of AMPs. After the change point, the means of AMPs did not go back to the previous. Alternately, BCPA can be stated to find variation points not change points because the means returned to their original values as time progressed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the GEV fused lasso method detects the change points of non-stationary AMPs of South Korea. This study can be extended to more extreme distributions for various meteorological variables. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Annual maximum precipitation; Bayesian change point analysis; Fused lasso penalty; GEV distribution; Skewness","Higher order statistics; Normal distribution; Rain; Annual maximum precipitation; Change-point analysis; Fused lassos; GEV distributions; Skewness; Numerical methods; annual variation; Bayesian analysis; comparative advantage; detection method; numerical model; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); skewness; weather station; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971280724

However, limited information is available on the effects of TBEOP on the endocrine system and its underlying mechanisms. We exposed adult zebrafish pairs to TBEOP at concentrations of 0, 2.1, 11, and 118 μg/L for 21 d, and investigated the effects on gene transcription and hormone production related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and on reproduction. The adverse effects on the F1 generation were further examined. In male fish, plasma concentrations of 17β-estradiol were significantly increased along with up-regulation of cyp19a. Exposure to TBEOP at 118 μg/L led to a significant decrease in average egg production. Exposure of the F0 generation to TBEOP delayed hatching and lowered hatching rates in the F1 generation. The results demonstrate that exposure to TBEOP at environmentally relevant concentration levels could affect the sex hormone balance by altering regulatory circuits of the HPG axis, eventually leading to disruption of reproductive performance and the development of offspring. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Endocrine disruption; HPG axis; Organophosphate flame retardants; TBEOP; Zebrafish","Transcription; Endocrine disruption; HPG axis; Organophosphate flame retardants; TBEOP; Zebrafish; Flame retardants; aromatase; estradiol; organophosphate; testosterone; tris(2 butoxyethyl)phosphate; unclassified drug; flame retardant; organophosphorus compound; tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate; water pollutant; cyprinid; endocrine disruptor; organophosphate; pollution effect; pollution exposure; reproduction; sex hormone; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cyp19a gene; developmental toxicity; egg production; environmental exposure; estradiol blood level; female; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; hatching; hormone synthesis; hypothalamus hypophysis gonad system; long term exposure; male; nonhuman; reproductive toxicity; testosterone blood level; toxicity testing; zebra fish; animal; drug effects; endocrine system; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; reproduction; toxicity; upregulation; water pollutant; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Animals; Endocrine System; Estradiol; Flame Retardants; Male; Organophosphorus Compounds; Reproduction; Up-Regulation; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964664275

To evaluate how the molecular structure of surfactant has an influence on the chemical decomposition rate of citral, micelles were prepared with polyoxyethylene alkyl ether-type surfactants that had similar molecular structures but various hydrophilic head sizes and hydrophobic tail lengths. RESULTS: At a critical 20× micelle concentration of surfactant, there was no significant difference in the chemical degradation rate of citral in micelles in neutral pH, regardless of the hydrophilic head size or hydrophobic tail length. In an acidic environment, the degradation rate constant of citral generally increased proportionally with increasing hydrophilic head size of surfactant (0.1563 and 0.2217 for surfactants with 23 and 100 oxyethylene units, respectively) but the length of hydrophobic tail did not affect the citral stability. Also, little difference (0.2217 and 0.2265 for surfactant having 100 oxyethylene units with and without Fe3+) in degradation rate constant of citral between simple micellar solution and micellar solution containing iron suggested that iron ions could not accelerate citral degradation in micelles, regardless of the form of iron (Fe2+ and Fe3+). CONCLUSION: This work concludes that although the concentration of surfactant could be relevant, if its concentration could be controlled in the same manner as the critical micelle concentration, then a polyethylene alkyl ether-type surfactant with a small hydrophilic head could more efficiently stabilize citral at an acidic pH. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.","Chemical decomposition; Citral; Micelles; Polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers; Storage stability","citral; flavoring agent; iron; macrogol derivative; micelle; Sanonic SS-90; surfactant; terpene; water; chemical phenomena; chemistry; micelle; pH; Flavoring Agents; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Iron; Micelles; Monoterpenes; Polyethylene Glycols; Surface-Active Agents; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951784058

Implementation of the programs requires improved infrastructure to create a safe walking environment to school. To achieve this goal, program participants should comprehensively and consistently evaluate the existing walking environments to prioritize the infrastructure required for improvement. However, in current practice, this evaluation process is challenging due to the lack of formal representation of the existing walking environments. To overcome this limitation, our research team developed an ontology required for the Building Information Model (BIM) to consistently and completely provide information about the existing walkability. The team applied this ontology to an elementary school in the United States and visualized the existing walkability by integrating BIM and Geographical Information System (GIS). Based on the visualization result, the team was able to explicitly describe the existing walkability to program participants.

Traditionally, big data with media-driven service have simply implied extensive amounts of data. However, this definition has evolved to include the extraction of values, analysis, and the prediction of results from a vast volume of unstructured and varied datasets. Because of the explosive growth of computer processing technologies, the creation of big data has originated from unstructured data, text data, image data, and location data created by a variety of digital devices. Classically, the storage of big data has been administered by companies that provide storage services or by specialized storage companies. Significant cost is incurred to store big data efficiently and maintain sufficient storage requirements, which increase continuously.

Contact lenses directly contact with human tears can be swelled or de-swelled depending on the pH of the solution due to the nature of the hydrogel. For examples, anionic hydrogels, when the solution's pH is low, is shrunken due to the electric attraction force within the hydrogel network; the opposite phenomenon appears when the solution is basic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of water soluble drug, hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose, released from contact lens according to the pH of the artificial tears. Artificial tears are prepared by mixing lysozyme, albumin, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride following physiological concentrations. Hydrogel contact lens was thermally polymerized using HEMA, EGDMA, and AIBN. The prepared hydrogel lens was immersed in drug for 3 hours and the eluted drug mass was measured as a function of the time. As a result, the drug was released from the lens for 12 hours in all the pH of artificial tears. At the lower pH of artificial tears (pH 5.8), the total amount of dye emitted from the lens was increased than the total amount of dye emitted at the basic tear (pH 8.4). Also, initial burst at acidic tears was increased within 1 hour. Release pattern of water-soluble drug from hydrogel lens turned out to be different depending on the pH of the artificial tears. When designing drug releasing contact lens, physiological pH of tears should be considered. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biochemical engineering; Contact lenses; Hydrogels; Physiology; Attraction force; Environmental factors; Hydrogel contact lens; Hydrogel networks; Physiological concentrations; Potassium chloride; Soft contact lens; Water soluble drugs; pH; body fluid; drug; eye; pH; physicochemical property; solubility",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988499881

A Q2Q1 element is adopted to solve the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations and a Q2-iso-Q1 to solve the level set equation. The integrated FEM solves pressure and velocity simultaneously in a strongly coupled manner; the level set function is reinitialized by adopting a direct approach using interfacial geometry information instead of solving a conventional hyperbolic-type equation. In addition, a consistent continuum surface force (consistent CSF) model is utilized by employing the same basis function for both surface tension and pressure variables to damp out spurious currents and to estimate the accurate pressure distribution. The model is further represented as a semi-implicit manner to improve temporal stability with an increased time step. In order to verify the accuracy and robustness of the code, the present method is applied to a few benchmark problems of the static bubble and rising bubble with large density and viscosity ratios. The Q2Q1-integrated FEM coupled with the semi-implicit consistent CSF demonstrates the significantly reduced spurious currents and improved temporal stability.

To support the integration process of DC microgrids with the existing AC utility grids, the form of hybrid AC/DC microgrids is considered for higher power conversion efficiency, lower component cost and better power quality. In the system, AC and DC portions are connected through interlink bidirectional AC/DC converters (IC) with a proper control system and power management. In the stand-alone operation mode of AC/DC hybrid microgrids, the control of power injection through the IC is crucial in order to maintain the system security. This paper mainly deals with a coordination control strategy of IC and a battery energy storage system (BESS) converter under stand-alone operation. A coordinated control strategy for the IC, which considers the state of charge (SOC) level of BESS and the load shedding scheme as the last resort, is proposed to obtain better power sharing between AC and DC subgrids. The scheme will be tested with a hybrid AC/DC microgrid, using the tool of the PSCAD/EMTDC software. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Battery energy storage system; Droop control; Hybrid AC/DC microgrid; Interlink bidirectional AC/DC converter; Power management","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Energy storage; Microgrids; Rectifying circuits; Software testing; Battery energy storage systems; Coordinated control strategy; Coordination control; Hybrid ac/dc microgrid; Integration process; Load shedding scheme; Power conversion efficiencies; Stand-alone operation; Power control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990852508

Pt and YSZ were deposited using sputter and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), respectively. Here, two types of Pt anode, i.e., dense and porous, were prepared to compare the performances of the fuel cells. The performance of the fuel cell with the porous Pt anode showed higher peak power density (194 mW/cm2) than that with the dense Pt anode (178 mW/cm2) at 500°C. Through the analyses via scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it was found that the increase of the performance was attributed to the enhanced supply of the hydrogen into the porous anode and resulting enhancement of charge transfer and mass transport. In the EIS results, the anodic charge transfer resistance of the fuel cell with the dense Pt anode was higher than that of the porous Pt anode, even though the porous Pt anode is thicker than the dense Pt anode. The result from a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron-dispersive spectroscopy images showed that anodic pores were slightly filled with YSZ due to the low conformality of PEALD, resulting in the additional formation of triple phase boundaries. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.","Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO); Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD); Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC); Thin film; Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)","Aluminum coatings; Anodes; Anodic oxidation; Atomic layer deposition; Charge transfer; Deposition; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electron microscopy; Fuel cells; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Platinum; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid electrolytes; Thin films; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Yttrium alloys; Zirconia; Anodic aluminum oxide; Charge transfer resistance; Peak power densities; Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition; Thin film solid oxide fuel cells; Triple phase boundary; YSZ electrolytes; Yttria-stabilized zirconias (YSZ); Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966687209

This allows visualization, monitoring, and control through various electronic devices, such as laptops, tablets, i-Pads, PCs, and cellular phones.

This study describes the deployment of a protocol whereby industrial system information can be securely accessed by cellular phones via a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) server. To achieve the study goals, proprietary protocol interconnectivity with non-proprietary protocols and the usage of interconnectivity services are considered in detail. They support the visualization of the SCADA system information, and the related operations through smart phones. The intelligent sensors are configured and designated to process real information via cellular phones by employing information exchange services between the proprietary protocol and non-proprietary protocols.

This scheme provides accurate position information in a structured environment but is limited to two-dimensional (2D) environments because the radiation power of the antenna depends on the elevation angle between the sending and receiving antennas. To overcome this problem, we propose a 3D localization scheme that considers the electromagnetic (EM) wave attenuation over the range of reliable elevation angles. In order to determine the reliable elevation scope, we analyzed the radiation patterns of dipole antennas. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated in distance estimation and 3D localization experiments by varying the distance and elevation angle. Encouraged by these results, we constructed an underwater wireless sensor network in the experimental basin, and performed ROV position tracking with the depth sensor. The scheme achieved reliable localization accuracy at a fast sampling rate, demonstrating the feasibility of exploiting EM wave attenuation in localization. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Commercial vehicles; Dipole antennas; Directional patterns (antenna); Electromagnetic waves; Radio communication; Receiving antennas; Remotely operated vehicles; Robotics; Tracking (position); Underwater acoustics; Wireless sensor networks; 3d underwater localizations; Distance estimation; Localization accuracy; Position information; Radio frequency sensors; Structured environment; Two Dimensional (2 D); Underwater wireless sensor networks; Remotely operated underwater vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977596691

Through direct surface modification with ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6), phosphorus can be successfully incorporated onto the surface of the carbon felt by forming phosphate functional groups with -OH chemical moieties that exhibit good hydrophilicity. The electrochemical reactivity of the carbon felt toward the redox reactions of VO2+/VO2+ (in the catholyte) and V3+/V2+ (in the anolyte) can be effectively improved owing to the superior catalytic effects of the oxygen-rich phosphate groups. Furthermore, undesirable hydrogen evolution can be suppressed by minimizing the overpotential for the V3+ /V2+ redox reaction in the anolyte of the VRFB. Cell-cycling tests with the catalyzed electrodes show improved energy efficiencies of 88.2 and 87.2% in the 1st and 20th cycles compared with 83.0 and 81.1 %, respectively, for the pristine electrodes at a constant current density of 32 mAcm-2.

In the DDA, the basic assumption is that the nodal demand is fully supplied irrespective of the nodal pressure, which is mainly suitable for normal operating conditions. However, in abnormal conditions, such as pipe failures or unexpected increase in demand, the DDA approach may cause unrealistic results, such as negative pressure. To address the shortcomings of DDA, PDA has been considered in a number of studies. For PDA, however, the head-outflow relation (HOR) should be given, which is known to contain a high degree of uncertainty. Here, the DDA-based simulator, EPANET2 was modified to develop a PDA model simulating pressure deficient conditions and a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was performed to consider the quantitative uncertainty in HOR. The developed PDA model was applied to two networks (a well-known benchmark system and a real-life WDN) and the results showed that the proposed model is superior to other reported models when dealing with negative pressure under abnormal conditions. In addition, the MCS-based sensitivity analysis presents the ranges of pressure and available discharge, quantifying service reliability of water networks. © IWA Publishing 2016.","Hydraulic analysis; Pressure-driven analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Water distribution network","Electric power distribution; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Reliability analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; Degree of uncertainty; Demand-driven analysis; Hydraulic analysis; Normal operating conditions; Pressure-driven; Uncertainty quantifications; Water distribution network models; Water distribution networks; Uncertainty analysis; benchmarking; distribution system; hydrological modeling; network analysis; operations technology; pressure effect; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; water demand; Article; energy conservation; Monte Carlo method; pressure; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; simulator; statistical model; uncertainty; water analysis; water distribution network; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979516928

To prepare the composite complex of the modified surface, the dimethicone, lauroyl lysine and triethoxycaprylylsilane were prepared by a dry process, and silica by a hydrothermal synthesis method. The HAp-silica was chosen as the best composite powder when measuring its sun protection levels. We investigated the characteristics of the surface of HAp-silica by SEM, particle size analyzer and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Additionally, the stability in the formulation, UV block effect, and safety in BB creams were investigated. In conclusion, HAp-silica prepared by the modification of HAp complex surface improved the skin usage and UV block effect by enhancing the white cloudy phenomenon. These results indicate that HAp-silica may be used for UV block cosmetics. © 2016 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

This paper presents the area-optimized AES-CCM (Advanced Encryption Standard –Counter with CBC-MAC) hardware security engine which can support both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 standards. First, for the low cost design, we propose the 8-bit AES encryption core with the S-box that consists of fully combinational logic based on composite field arithmetic. We also exploit the toggle method to reduce the complexity of design further by reusing the AES core for performing two operation mode of AES-CCM. The implementation results show that the total gate count of proposed AES-CCM security engine can be reduced by up to 42.5% compared to the conventional design. © 2016, Institute of Electronics Engineers of Korea.

The SAW sensor utilizes a shear horizontal wave and split interdigital transducer (IDT). After the SAW sensor was attached to the tire specimen, the characteristics of the SAW sensor were investigated using tensile and three-point bending tests, respectively. When external deformation is applied to the SAW sensor, the strain of the piezoelectric substrate changes the distance between the two IDTs and alters the velocity of the propagating SAW, resulting in a change in the center frequency of the SAW sensor. Based on the degree of changes in the center frequency, we can evaluate the extent of the tire deformation. The center frequency linearly decreases by 20 kHz as the tire is strained to 20%. As the tire specimen with SAW sensor was bent upto 2 mm, the center frequency linearly decreased by 25 kHz. The sensitivity and linearity of the SAW strain sensor were measured to be 2.5 kHz/% and 0.97.

The distance estimation is based on signal attenuation characteristics of electromagnetic waves radiated through several omnidirectional antennas. Positions in underwater environments have been predominantly estimated by an ultrasonic position recognition system using travel time and phase difference. However, such a system provides inaccurate estimation on account of the multipath effect in a structured environment or complex environment with many obstacles. A position estimation method that uses signal attenuation of electromagnetic waves has been proposed to overcome this limitation. That method can precisely estimate position on a structured 2-D plane. In this paper, an existing underwater position estimation system based on electromagnetic waves is expanded into 3-D space using the Friis formula and plane wave equation, thereby classifying attenuation characteristics of electromagnetic waves into the effects of medium, radiation, and antenna. These effects are summarized to deduce the signal attenuation characteristics of electromagnetic waves in 3-D space. In addition, the relative position (R, Θ, Φ) and attitude ( φ, θ, ψ of transceiver antennas are used to define a coordinate system for 3-D estimation; moreover, an attenuation model is defined for individual factors in the coordinate system. A generalized attenuation model of an omnidirectional antenna in 3-D space is presented, and the validity of the proposed model is demonstrated through experiments. Based on the results, the proposed model demonstrates the potential application to an omnidirectional antenna and expansion into an attenuation model based on the 3-D position between random antennas. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Electromagnetic waves; Received Signal Strength; Sensor Network; Underwater Localization","Antennas; Circular waveguides; Complex networks; Electromagnetic waves; Omnidirectional antennas; Position measurement; Radiation effects; Radio transceivers; Sensor networks; Signal processing; Telecommunication networks; Three dimensional computer graphics; Travel time; Underwater acoustics; Attenuation characteristics; Complex environments; Position estimation system; Received signal strength; Spatial attenuations; Structured environment; Underwater environments; Underwater localization; Electromagnetic wave attenuation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969822451

The PS (Experiment 1) or PB/SM (Experiment 2) supplement was administered orally once daily for 7 days prior to inducing platelet activation at the last day. Orally administered PS showed an additive and positive effect on nitric oxide (NO) availability, adhesion molecule/pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and thrombosis compared to controls.

Eight types of strain-based API X60 pipeline steels were fabricated by varying the chemical compositions, such as C, Ni, Cr, and Mo, and the finish cooling temperatures, such as single-phase and dual-phase regions. In the 4N and 5C steels, the volume fractions of bainitic ferrite (BF) and the secondary phases increased with the increasing C and adding Cr instead of Ni. In the 5C and 6NC steels, the volume fractions of acicular ferrite (AF) and BF decreased with increasing C and adding Ni, whereas the volume fractions of polygonal ferrite (PF) and the secondary phases increased. In the 6NC and 6NM steels, the volume fraction of BF was increased by adding Mo instead of Cr, whereas the volume fractions of PF and the secondary phases decreased. In the steels rolled in the single-phase region, the volume fraction of polygonal ferrite ranged from 40 to 60 pct and the volume fraction of AF ranged from 20 to 40 pct. In the steels rolled in the dual-phase region, however, the volume fraction of PF was more than 70 pct and the volume fraction of AF was below 20 pct. The strength of the steels with a high volume fraction of AF was higher than those of the steels with a high volume fraction of PF, whereas the yield point elongation and the strain hardening exponent were opposite.

The primary purpose of this paper is to address evolutionary aspects of industrial technology roadmap for the South Korea case and provide a more advanced framework of public R&D planning.Since 2000, technology roadmapping has been initiated by the government agency in South Korea, and, more recently, this practice has become popularized in small- and medium-sized companies as well. Despite the popularity, practitioners have some difficulties in finding practical guidelines and systematic processes for developing technology roadmaps applicable to R&D planning within an organization. The framework of industrial technology roadmapping developed by the Korea Institute for the Advancement of Technology can be applied or modified to the R&D planning process of similar projects. This roadmapping process deals with a variety of industries with different characteristics, and provides a systematic mechanism to predict future market demands and technology innovations. Finally, this paper shed some lights on the major challenges, potential roadblocks and proposed recommendations in roadmapping process. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Industrial technology roadmap; R&D planning; Technology forecasting; Technology roadmapping","Innovation; Evolutionary aspects; Industrial technology; Practical guidelines; Small and medium-sized companies; Technological progress; Technology forecasting; Technology innovation; Technology roadmapping; Technological forecasting; forecasting method; industrial technology; innovation; market conditions; organizational framework; planning method; research and development; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962343436

Descriptions of mitochondrial morphology have been non-systematic and qualitative, due to lack of knowledge on the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial dynamics. The current study analyzed mitochondrial size, shape, and position quantitatively in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) using a systematic computational model to suggest mitochondrial trafficking under oxidative environment. Our previous proteomic study suggested that prohibitin is a mitochondrial decay biomarker in the RPE. The current study examined the prohibitin interactome map using immunoprecipitation data to determine the indirect signaling on cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional regulation by prohibitin. Immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between mitochondrial changes and altered filaments as well as prohibitin interactions with kinesin and unknown proteins in the RPE. Specific cytoskeletal and nuclear protein-binding mechanisms may exist to regulate prohibitin-mediated reactions as key elements, including vimentin and p53, to control apoptosis in mitochondria and the nucleus. Prohibitin may regulate mitochondrial trafficking through unknown proteins that include 110 kDa protein with myosin head domain and 88 kDa protein with cadherin repeat domain. Altered cytoskeleton may represent a mitochondrial decay signature in the RPE. The current study suggests that mitochondrial dynamics and cytoskeletal changes are critical for controlling mitochondrial distribution and function. Further, imbalance of retrograde versus anterograde mitochondrial trafficking may initiate the pathogenic reaction in adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cytoskeleton; Mitochondria; Oxidative stress; Prohibitin; Protein interactome; Retinal pigment epithelium","biological marker; kinesin; prohibitin; protein p53; prohibitin; repressor protein; aging; apoptosis; Article; cell aging; cell shape; cytoskeleton; depolymerization; human; immunoblotting; immunocytochemistry; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; mitochondrial decay; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial volume; mitochondrion; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein protein interaction; retinal pigment epithelium; signal transduction; two dimensional electrophoresis; animal; cell line; cytology; cytoskeleton; female; metabolism; mitochondrion; mouse; oxidative stress; protein protein interaction; retinal pigment epithelium; ultrastructure; Animals; Cell Line; Cytoskeleton; Female; Humans; Mice; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Oxidative Stress; Protein Interaction Maps; Repressor Proteins; Retinal Pigment Epithelium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962222370

The proposed ROLIF neuron offers biologically plausible features such as analog-type encoding, signal amplification, unidirectional synaptic transmission, and Poisson noise. The synaptic transmission between pre- and postsynaptic neurons is achieved through a passive synapse (simple resistor). The synaptic resistor coupled to the non-ideal op-amp realizes excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) evolution that evokes postsynaptic neuron spiking. In an attempt to generalize our proposed model, we theoretically examine ROLIF neuron circuits adopting different non-ideal op-amps having different gains and slew rates. The simulation results indicate the importance of gain in postsynaptic neuron spiking, irrespective of the slew rate (as long as the rate exceeds a particular value), providing the basis for the ROLIF neuron circuit design. Eventually, the behavior of a postsynaptic neuron in connection to multiple presynaptic neurons via synapses is highlighted in terms of EPSP evolution amid simultaneously incident asynchronous presynaptic spikes, which in fact reveals an important role of the random noise in spatial integration. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Integrated circuit manufacture; Neurons; Operational amplifiers; Reconfigurable hardware; Relaxation oscillators; Resistors; Amorphous chalcogenide; Excitatory post synaptic potentials; Operational amplifier (op amp); Post-synaptic neurons; Pre-synaptic neuron; Signal amplifications; Spatial integrations; Synaptic transmission; Oscillators (electronic)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971606740

This study aimed to conduct a pioneering investigation to clarify this issue in healthy subjects by adopting a dietary cholesterol challenge, which has not been used previously in similar studies of Chlorella in hypercholesterolemia. Methods: In this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 34 participants ingested 510 mg of dietary cholesterol from three eggs concomitantly with a usual dose of Chlorella (5 g/d) or a matched placebo for 4 weeks. Results: The dietary cholesterol challenge induced consistently higher concentrations of serum total cholesterol (TC, P &lt; 0.001), LDL-C (P = 0.004), and HDL-C (P = 0.010) compared with baseline values, suggesting that the challenge was reliable. Thus, we observed a preventive action of Chlorella in maintaining serum TC versus placebo levels (3.5 % versus 9.8 %, respectively; P = 0.037) and LDL-C versus placebo levels (1.7 % versus 14.3 %, respectively; P = 0.012) against excessive dietary cholesterol intake and in augmenting HDL-C versus placebo levels (8.3 % versus 3.8 %, respectively).

Due to the proposed symmetrical resonant tank with notch resonant characteristic, the proposed converter is capable of not only achieving soft switching of all switches in forward and backward modes but also operating in a narrow switching frequency range even under wide voltage range. Also, due to zero gain at the notch resonant frequency, the proposed converter does not suffer from increased current and voltage stresses of components during start-up. The current rating of the resonant capacitor does not increases as the load increases and can further be reduced by adjusting the tertiary turn ratio of the transformer, making the proposed converter more realizable in high power application.

Since the job performance of call center agents who carry out debt collection is primarily evaluated by the amount of debt collected, call center managers are faced with the challenge of allocating customer contact lists in a fair manner to eliminate a non-controllable external factor that could distort the objective evaluation of the agent's job performance. In this paper, we develop five machine learning-based late payment prediction models and ten customer scoring rules to predict the payment likelihood and the amount of the late payment for the customers who currently have an unpaid debt. The proposed scoring rules are verified under ten different contexts by varying the number of agents. Experimental results confirm that the prediction model-based scoring rules lead to fairer customer allocation results among the agents compared to the existing heuristic-based customer scoring rules.

In this study, the simple, low-cost and scalable synthesis of FeCo nanofibers is demonstrated by combining an electrospinning process with sequential thermal treatment involving calcination in air followed by reduction in H2 atmosphere. A citric acid has an influence on the morphology of the electrospun product. The as-spun precursor nanofibers are transformed into CoFe2O4 and FeCo phases through the sequential thermal treatment while maintaining the fibrous shapes. To evaluate the electromagnetic (EM) wave-absorbing abilities of the FeCo nanofibers, epoxy matrix composites with the nanofibers are fabricated. The composites show excellent EM wave absorption properties where the power loss of the FeCo nanofibers increased to 20 GHz without any degradation.

A thin hinge bracket is typically produced by bending a sheet panel or welding a hollow bar into a sheet panel. However, the hinge bracket made by bending or welding does not have sufficient durability in severe operating conditions because of the stress concentration in the bended region or the low corrosion resistance of the welded region. Therefore, this study uses forming to produce the hinge bracket part of a foldable container and to ensure durability in difficult operating conditions. An extrusion process for a T-shaped hinge bracket is studied using finite element analysis. Preliminary analysis shows that a very high forging load is required to form the bracket by forging. Therefore, extrusion is considered as a candidate process. Producing the part through the extrusion process enables many brackets to be made in a single extrusion and through successive cutting of the extruded part, thereby reducing the manufacturing cost. The design focuses on reducing the extrusion load and on ensuring shape accuracy. An initial billet is designed to reduce the extrusion load and to obtain a geometrically accurate part. The extruded part is bent frequently because of uneven material flow. Thus, extrusion die geometries are designed to obtain straight parts. © 2016, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Die design; Extrusion; Extrusion load; Hinge bracket","Corrosion resistance; Design; Durability; Finite element method; Forging; Welding; Die design; Extrusion load; Extrusion process; Manufacturing cost; Material Flow; Operating condition; Optimal design; Preliminary analysis; Extrusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971507702

The CUPID code has been validated against a set of conceptual problems and experimental data. In this work, the CUPID code has been parallelized based on the domain decomposition method with Message passing interface (MPI) library. For domain decomposition, the CUPID code provides both manual and automatic methods with METIS library. For the effective memory management, the Compressed sparse row (CSR) format is adopted, which is one of the methods to represent the sparse asymmetric matrix. CSR format saves only non-zero value and its position (row and column). By performing the verification for the fundamental problem set, the parallelization of the CUPID has been successfully confirmed. Since the scalability of a parallel simulation is generally known to be better for fine mesh system, three different scales of mesh system are considered: 40000 meshes for coarse mesh system, 320000 meshes for mid-size mesh system, and 2560000 meshes for fine mesh system. In the given geometry, both single- and two-phase calculations were conducted. In addition, two types of preconditioners for a matrix solver were compared: Diagonal and incomplete LU preconditioner. In terms of enhancement of the parallel performance, the OpenMP & MPI hybrid parallel computing for a pressure solver was examined. It is revealed that the scalability of hybrid calculation was enhanced for the multi-core parallel computation. © 2016, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CUPID; Domain decomposition method; Hybrid computing; Parallel computing; Two phase flow","Application programming interfaces (API); Atomic physics; Codes (symbols); Domain decomposition methods; Light water reactors; Matrix algebra; Mesh generation; Message passing; Nuclear reactors; Parallel processing systems; Scalability; Compressed sparse row; CUPID; Hybrid computing; Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute; Message passing interface libraries; Multi-core parallels; Parallel simulations; Two-phase calculations; Two phase flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970967290

Smartphones feature the essential elements of AR implementation, such as a camera, a processor and a display in a single device. As a result, additional hardware expansion for AR implementation has become unnecessary, popularizing AR technology at the user level. In the early stages, low-level AR technology was used mainly in limited fields, including simple road guides and marker-based recognition. Due to advances in AR technology, the range of usage has expanded as diverse technologies and purposes are combined. Users' expectations of AR technology have also increased with this trend, and a high quality of service (QoS), with high-resolution, high-quality images, is now available. However, there are limitations in terms of processing speed and graphic treatment with smart devices, which, due to their small size, have inferior performance compared to the desktop environment when processing data for the implementation of high-resolution, high-quality images. This paper proposes an optional frame-selection algorithm (OFSA), which eliminates the unnecessary work involved with redundant frames during rendering for adaptive symmetric service of augmented reality big data on smart devices. Moreover, the memory read-write delay of the internally-operating OFSA, is minimized by adding an adaptive operation function. It is possible to provide adaptive common AR images at an improved frame rate in heterogeneous smart devices with different levels of performance. © 2016 by the authors.","Augmented reality; Frame rate; Heterogeneous adaptiveness; Smart device; Snapshot",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969816464

Thus, many researchers have attempted to prepare highly active TiO2 materials using various synthetic approaches. Modifications of the conventional sol-gel method, such as the addition of surfactants, have been employed in synthetic procedures. Moreover, hydrothermal, solvothermal, sonochemical and microwave methods have also been used as alternative approaches. Recently, the use of ionic liquids represents a burgeoning direction in inorganic material synthesis. Ionic liquids are exceptional solvents consisting of ions possessing low vapor pressure and tunable solvent properties. This article reviews the preparation of TiO2 materials using ionic liquids with various synthetic approaches.

However, self-report questionnaires are vulnerable to social desirability bias due to respondents’ tendencies to answer in a more socially acceptable way. This is a problem as social desirability bias threatens the validity of the measure. This study investigates whether characteristics of national culture influence social desirability bias during surveys on public service motivation. In particular, the impact of social desirability bias is analyzed with two concerns in mind: construct validity and inference validity of public service motivation measures. Experimental survey research (list experiment) is conducted to examine the magnitude of social desirability bias and its associations with national cultures in four countries: Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States. The results show that respondents in both collectivistic countries (Japan and Korea) and individualistic countries (the Netherlands and the United States) are likely to over-report answers on items of public service motivation, although the magnitude and pattern of this bias is stronger and more consistent in collectivistic countries. This study also finds a strong possibility of a moderator effect in correlational analyses in collectivistic countries, but it is doubtful this effect is present in individualistic countries. Overall, we suggest that the effects of social desirability bias should be investigated in public service motivation research, and social desirability bias should be controlled for in future research. © 2013, © The Authors 2013.","experimental survey research; national culture; public service motivation; social desirability bias",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962097315

Numerical results show that constant elastic moduli of hypoelastic material models can cause considerable errors in stress and strain increments when the changes in volume and cross-sectional area of a material are not negligible. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"Constitutive equations; Copper; Deformation; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Single crystals; Strain energy; Face-centered-cubic single crystals; Finite element programs; Hyperelastic material models; Incremental formulation; Interatomic potential; Large deformation analysis; Single crystal copper; Strain energy functions; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955281588

Although low-rise buildings have been constructed worldwide using this method for more than 30 years, it is a relatively new technology in high-rise construction. There are three basic methods of constructing high-rise buildings using modular construction: the core method, the core-and-podium combination method, and the modular in-fill method. While the first two have been used in the USA and in several European countries, the third method, introduced in 2011 by an international cruise ship development firm, is a rather new approach for which there are few case histories. Although the modular in-fill method is being used to construct several dormitories in Korea through public–private partnerships with the Korean government, there have been few applications of this method to construction of high-rise buildings. Therefore, its applicability and construction feasibility should be verified. As a pilot study to test the applicability of the modular in-fill method, a 12-story residential building was built in Korea. This paper describes a case study of the pilot project. The advantages and disadvantages of the method and its applicability in terms of cost effectiveness and construction schedule management were evaluated. The results of this study provide a reference base for advancement of the in-fill method based on an analysis of problems that arose during the construction process for the pilot project. © 2016, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","cost effectiveness; modular in-fill method; modular technology; prefabricated construction; schedule compression","Buildings; Cost effectiveness; Modular construction; Prefabricated construction; Tall buildings; Construction feasibility; Construction process; Construction schedules; High-rise construction; modular in-fill method; Private partnerships; Residential building; Schedule compression; Construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930899718

Therefore, a quality of a variety of cloud computing systems is affected by the virtualization quality. Many factors which decide the virtualization quality and characteristics have been studied. However, when we apply the cloud computing system to our organization the priorities of the key factors should be decided and according to the priorities resourves must be alloted.

The sensor 1 displayed a selective and sensitive detecting ability for aluminum (III) ion by 'OFF-ON' fluorescent response in aqueous solution. This sensing mechanism might be due to the inhibition of C=N isomerization, and the activation of chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF). This sensing mechanism of 1 for Al3+ was supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, sensor 1 had a low detection limit (6.4 μM), which is below than the WHO recommendation level (7.41 μM) for drinking water. Importantly, the chemosensor 1 could be applied to living cells to detect Al3+.

Si wafers with or without Cu TSV were point-heated at various temperatures and thermal diffusion in the specimens was observed using IR microscope. Si wafers with Cu TSV showed higher top surface temperature than ones without Cu TSV as the heating power increased. This phenomenon was attributed to the preferred heat transfer through Cu TSV in the vertical direction due to high thermal conductivity of Cu.

In particular, global mobile firms focus on technological competition when jostling for market position in recognition of the strategic need to secure a strong mobile platform. In this paper, we analyse the network structure of technological knowledge flows in mobile ecosystems using US patent citation information. We find that two subsectors, platform providers and application and software providers, are at the centre of knowledge exchange activity and play a brokerage role as the key knowledge mediator. Then, we categorise mobile firms into five different groups based on the patterns of their network centrality: knowledge keystone players, knowledge-distributing mediators, knowledge-absorbing mediators, catch-up players, and pure knowledge receivers. The categorisation of firms demonstrates that knowledge flows in the mobile industry converge towards a few leading firms, and such patterns are shaping the mobile ecosystem with respect to technological knowledge. The firms categorised as catch-up players have played a brokerage role within their group, while the firms categorised as knowledge keystone players play a brokerage role across different groups. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Brokerage measurement; knowledge flows; mobile ecosystem; network analysis; patent citation","intellectual property rights; knowledge; mobile communication; network analysis; software; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958184995

Polymeric materials are used because of the ease of fabrication, flexibility, and their biocompatible nature as well as their wide range of mechanical, electrical, chemical, and thermal behaviors when combined with different materials as composites. Biocompatible and biostable polymers are extensively used to package implanted devices, with the main criteria that include gas permeability and water permeability of the packaging polymer to protect the electronic circuit of the device from moisture and ions inside the human body. Polymeric materials must also have considerable tensile strength and should be able to contain the device over the envisioned lifetime of the implant. For substrates, structural properties and, at times, electrical properties would be of greater concern. Section 1gives an introduction of some medical devices and implants along with the material requirements and properties needed. Different synthetic polymeric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride, polyethylene, polypropylene, polydimethylsiloxane, parylene, polyamide, polytetrafluoroethylene, poly(methyl methacrylate), polyimide, and polyurethane have been examined, and liquid crystalline polymers and nanocomposites have been evaluated as biomaterials that are suitable for biomedical packaging (section 2).

Here, we present the development of hybrid functional 1-dimensional carbon structures incorporated homogeneously with high contents of non-precious metal multi-dopants, consisting of iron, cobalt and nitrogen, as a promising alternative to Pt-based catalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through a modified electrospinning technique. These hybrid heterobimetal-nitrogen-incorporated carbon structures exhibit superior ORR electrocatalytic properties i.e., more positive reduction potential, high electroreduction current density, high electron transfer value (∼3.87) close to the perfect ORR and improved electrochemical stability with a very small decrease of ∼8 mV in half-wave potential. The observed enhancement in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the increased amount of catalytically active sites with relatively high contents of heterometallic iron and cobalt atoms surrounded by nitrogen species and their homogeneous distribution on the catalyst surface. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Cobalt; Electrocatalysts; Fuel cells; Nitrogen; Platinum; Platinum alloys; Platinum metals; Precious metals; Reduction; Cathodic oxygen reduction; Electrocatalytic properties; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical stabilities; Electrospinning techniques; Non-precious metal catalysts; Oxygen electro reductions; Technological significance; Electrolytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963761149

We show that weighting each coordinate i according to an estimate of the variation of f along coordinate i - e.g. the L1 norm of the ith-directional derivative of f - is an efficient way to significantly improve the performance of distance-based regressors such as kernel and k-NN regressors. The approach, termed Gradient Weighting (GW), consists of a first pass regression estimate fn which serves to evaluate the directional derivatives of f, and a second-pass regression estimate on the re-weighted data. The GW approach can be instantiated for both regression and classification, and is grounded in strong theoretical principles having to do with the way regression bias and variance are affected by a generic feature-weighting scheme. These theoretical principles provide further technical foundation for some existing feature-weighting heuristics that have proved successful in practice. We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. The proposed estimator computes efficiently and easily extends to run online. We then derive a classification version of the GW approach which evaluates on real-worlds datasets with as much success as its regression counterpart. ©2016 Samory Kpotufe, Abdeslam Boularias, Thomas Schultz, and Kyoungok Kim.","Feature selection; Feature weighting; Metric learning; Nonparametric learning; Nonparametric sparsity","Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Nearest neighbor search; Bias and variance; Directional derivative; Feature weighting; Generic features; Metric learning; Non-parametric; Regression estimates; Regression problem; Regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979888015

To better understand KOMPSAT-3A positional accuracy, this paper reports a test result on the accuracy of recently released KOMPSAT-3A beta test images. A number of ground points were acquired from 1:1,000 digital topographic maps over the target area for the accuracy validation. First, the original RPCs (Rational Polynomial Coefficients) were validated without any GCPs (Ground Control Points). Then we continued the test by modeling the errors in the image space using shift-only, shift and drift, and the affine model. Ground restitution accuracy was also analyzed even though the across track image pairs do not have optimal convergence angle. The experimental results showed that the shift and drift-based RPCs correction was optimal showing comparable accuracy of less than 1.5 pixels with less GCPs compared to the affine model.","GCPs; High-resolution Satellite Images; Kompsat-3A; Positional Accuracy; RPCs","accuracy assessment; image resolution; satellite data; satellite imagery; topography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974777315

For plasma treated sample, experimental I-V data were explained by TE or TE combined with barrier lowering models at low and high temperatures. However, the current transport was explained by a thermionic field emission (TFE) model at intermediate temperatures. From X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, phosphorus vacancies (VP) were suggested to be generated after oxygen plasma treatment. VP possibly involves defects contributing to the current transport at intermediate temperatures.

The unique reaction of amylosucrase caused a decrease and an increase in the proportion of short chains and long chains, respectively, via attachment of glucosyl units to the non-reducing ends of branch chains. The in vitro digestion profile of amylosucrase-modified starch revealed that elongated branch chains were the main reason for high contents of slowly digestible and resistant starches due to formation of a more perfect crystalline structure via easy association between elongated branch chains. The glucose response in mice after consumption of amylosucrase-modified starch was similar to the response for commercial resistant starch with a gradual increase followed by a gradual decrease in blood glucose concentrations over a prolonged time.

In the case of sloshing, numerical results were found to be in good agreement with existing experimental data. The direct reinitialization approach consumed considerably less CPU time than the PDE-based simulations for 20 time periods of sloshing. This approach was stable, accurate, and efficient for all the problems considered in this study. © 2016, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Finite element method; Free-surface flow; Level set method; Reinitialization; Unstructured mesh","Drop breakup; Least squares approximations; Level measurement; Numerical methods; Advection equations; Comparative studies; Free-surface flow; Hyperbolic partial differential equation; Level Set method; Reinitialization; Unstructured meshes; Weighted residual method; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963526278

A scanning acoustic microscope (SAM), with a tone-burst ultrasonic wave frequency of 200 MHz, was used for the measurement of near surface stresses in the dissimilar welded plate between 304 stainless steel and low carbon steel. For quantitative data acquisition such as leaky surface acoustic wave (leaky SAW) velocity measurement, a point focus acoustic lens of frequency 200 MHz was used and the leaky SAW velocities within the specimen were precisely measured. The distributions of the surface acoustic wave velocities change according to the near-surface stresses within the joint. A three dimensional (3D) finite element simulation was carried out to predict numerically the stress distributions and compare with the experimental results. The experiment and FE simulation results for the dissimilar welded plate showed good agreement. This research demonstrates that a combination of FE simulation and ultrasonic stress measurements using SAW velocity distributions appear promising for determining welding residual stresses in dissimilar material joints. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While longer sensing and reporting time will improve the sensing performance, this shortens the allowable data transmission time, which in turn degrades the throughput of secondary users. In a cognitive radio network with multi-primary bands, the reporting time increases with the number of reporting nodes and primary bands to be reported. This paper proposes a limited reporting scheme for multiband cooperative spectrum sensing with a soft combination rule in order to reduce the reporting time while satisfying the detection probability constraint. In the proposed reporting scheme, the upper bound of the number of reporting nodes and the reported primary bands are dynamically controlled according to the number of cooperative secondary users. We formulate a trade-off between the throughput of secondary users and the overheads of cooperative spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that the sensing time and reporting time should be jointly optimized in order to maximize the throughput of secondary users. Moreover, in comparison with the conventional sensing-throughput optimization schemes, the proposed reporting scheme significantly increases the throughput of secondary users by reducing the reporting time. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Direct yaw moment control is used to derive the control yaw moment needed to stabilize the lateral motion of a vehicle. The yaw moment distribution is formulated as an optimization problem, whose objective is to coordinate the braking of electronic stability control and the corrective steering obtained by active front steering. To tune the relative magnitude of the braking of electronic stability control to the corrective steering obtained by active front steering, an adaptive tuning rule is proposed. To cope with the situation that the lateral tyre force of active front steering exceeds its physical limit, a new constraint is added to the original optimization problem. To solve the problem, weighted pseudo-inverse-based control allocation is adopted.

A variety of symmetry breaking sectors are studied, with a focus on the constraints placed on model parameters by the lightest neutral CP even Higgs boson mass Mh. The breaking of SU(2)R symmetry is achieved by Higgs fields transforming either as triplets or doublets, and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by either bi-doublets or doublets. The Higgs potential is analyzed with or without a gauge singlet Higgs field present. Seesaw models of Type I and Type II, inverse seesaw models, universal seesaw models and an E6 inspired alternate left-right model are included in our analysis. Several of these models lead to the tree-level relation Mh≤2mW (rather than Mh≤mZ that arises in the MSSM), realized when the SU(2)R symmetry breaking scale is of order TeV. With such an enhanced upper limit, it becomes possible to accommodate a Higgs boson of mass 126 GeV with relatively light stops that mix negligibly. In models with Higgs triplets, a doubly charged scalar remains light below a TeV with its mass arising entirely from radiative corrections. We carry out the complete one-loop calculation for its mass induced by the Majorana Yukawa couplings and show the consistency of the framework. We argue that these models prefer a low SU(2)R breaking scale. Other theoretical and phenomenological implications of these models are briefly discussed. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962436392

Inherently, there could be many false positives. Hypothesis generation and verification paradigm is adopted by integrating laser range finder with camera on video surveillance. Conventional background updating algorithm is used for generating foreground objects. They are verified by depth value provided by laser range finder.

Phthalates are ubiquitously present in indoor environment and could enter humans. Vinyl or PVC floorings have been recognized as one of important sources of phthalate release to indoor environment including house dust. In the present study, we estimated the migration of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) from the flooring materials into the dust under different heating conditions. For this purpose, a small chamber specifically designed for the present study and a Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC) were used, and four major types of PVC flooring samples including two UV curing paint coated, an uncoated residential, and a wax-coated commercial type were tested. Migration of DEHP was observed for an uncoated residential type and a wax-coated commercial type flooring. After 14. days of incubation, the levels of DEHP in the dust sample was determined at room temperature on average (standard deviation) at 384 ± 19 and 481 ± 53. μg/g, respectively. In contrast, migration of DINP was not observed. The migration of DEHP was strongly influenced by surface characteristics such as UV curing coating. In the residential flooring coated with UV curing paint, migration of DEHP was not observed at room temperature. But under the heated condition, the release of DEHP was observed in the dust in the FLEC. Migration of DEHP from flooring materials increased when the flooring was heated (50. °C). In Korea, heated flooring system, or 'ondol', is very common mode of heating in residential setting, therefore the contribution of PVC flooring to the total indoor DEHP exposure among general population is expected to be greater especially during winter season when the floor is heated. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP); Di-isononyl phthalate (DINP); Dust; Heating; Migration; Phthalates","Building materials; Curing; Dust; Endocrine disrupters; Esters; Heating; Housing; Paint; Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate; Di-isononyl phthalate; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Human health effects; Migration; Phthalates; Surface characteristics; Surface temperatures; Floors; diisononylphthalate; paint; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid derivative; polyvinylchloride; unclassified drug; air pollutant; phthalic acid; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid derivative; plasticizer; polyvinylchloride; chemical pollutant; dust; endocrine disruptor; environmental risk; health impact; health risk; heating; phthalate; surface temperature; Article; building material; chemical analysis; controlled study; dust; heating; material coating; pollution transport; priority journal; room temperature; South Korea; surface property; air pollutant; analysis; building; building material; chemical model; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; Construction Materials; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; Environmental Monitoring; Floors and Floorcoverings; Models, Chemical; Phthalic Acids; Plasticizers; Polyvinyl Chloride; Republic of Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955264919

Besides, the dispensing method consume a large amount of phosphor and silicone to fill the LED package. Thus, studies that manufacture phosphor layer with a uniform thickness such as spray coating, screen printing, electrophoresis are active recently. The purpose of this study is to perform the basic research about the change of the characteristics of phosphor film that is molded with uniform thickness using the phosphor slurry according to various silicone resin and phosphor composition ratio. It is expected to be used as useful information for the fabricating properties when production environment of phosphor layer is changed dispensing method into phosphor film fabrication. In the experiment, it was selected three kinds of methyl-phenyl silicone based resin as the phosphor slurry constituents, and mixed with phosphor various amount of 20 ∼ 60wt% content per one silicone resin. Using this mixed phosphor slurry, it was molded the phosphor film with 300 μm thickness and analyzed the mechanical properties and optical properties of the phosphor film. Finally, the results of this study are presented below: (a) As the phenyl group content is increased, the total heat of reaction need to cure the silicone resin is decrease, and also lower the durometer hardness of the phosphor sheet. On the other hand, it was confirmed that there is no relationship between the phenyl group content in the phosphor film and optical characteristics of the phosphor film. (b) If the amount of the phosphor within the film are increased, then the values of shore hardness and CIE color coordinates are increased gradually but the value of CIE color temperature is decreased gradually in case of being applied same silicone resin to the phosphor film. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.","conformal phosphor film; LED package; phosphor weight percent; silicone resin; the properties of the phosphor film",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984541529

Our result demonstrates that LGFU amplitudes can be sufficiently higher than a threshold for free-field cavitation at a microscale spot, which is a crucial step for cavitation-based therapy with high precision. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Physical properties; Physics; Bubble radius; Focused ultrasound; Free field conditions; High-precision; Laser energies; Peak pressure; Temporal width; Ultrasonic focusing; Cavitation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993975994

The experiments are carried out under different conditions of flow type and particle size. From calculation results, it is known that σ is calibrated to be 0.25 to 2.0 as the particle size changes from 320 to 130. The value of σ shows the inverse-relationship with particle size. determines the particle diffusivity. When is smaller than 1.0, the particle diffusivity becomes larger than the momentum diffusivity. A large particle having large inertia can diffuse relatively more compared to small particle under the condition that the turbulent intensity decreases. Therefore, σ is calibrated to be small as the particle size increases. This idea is examined by calculating the Stokes number and sediment diffusivity. As the particle size increases, both of Stokes number and sediment diffusivity also increase. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2016.","Particle inertia; Sediment diffusivity; Stokes number","calibration; diffusivity; experimental study; inverse analysis; mathematical analysis; momentum; particle size; Stokes formula; turbulent flow",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987740934

Furthermore, we discussed the results of post-Ag plating with respect to removal level of the oxide layer.

With the results of Auger electron spectroscopy using oxidized Cu plates, the concentrations required to completely remove 50-nm-thick and 2-nm-thick oxides within 5 min were determined to be X2.5 and X0.13. However, the optimal concentrations in an actual Ag plating process using Cu powder increased to X0.4 and X0.5, respectively, because the oxidation in powder may be accelerated and the complete removal of oxide should be tuned to the thickest oxide layer among all the particles.

The first is to identify O&F industry and estimate its market size using 2012 Input-Output (I-O) table published by the Bank of Korea. The second purpose is to obtain some quantitative information on production-inducing effect, value-added creation effect, and employment-inducing effect of the O&F industry. To this end, we apply an IO analysis using exogenous specification of the O&F industry. The results show that the O&F industry covers 4.1% and 3.0% of national output and gross domestic product, respectively. Moreover, we found that 1.0 won of production or investment in the O&F industry induces 1.7363 won of production and 0.4759 won of value-added in the national economy.

RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) climate change scenarios from the HadGEM3-RA RCM model were used to generate future climate scenarios, and daily runoff series were constructed based on the SWAT model. The indicators of the hydrologic alteration (IHA) program was used to carry out a quantitative assessment on the variability of runoff during two future periods (2011-2050, 2051-2100) compared to a reference period (1981-2006). Analyses of changes in the runoff characteristics of the lower Geum River showed that climate change is likely to lead to an increase of the future runoff ratio and that weirs contributed to an increase in the minimum discharge and a decrease in the maximum discharge.

The main challenge associated with the grid-connected inverter in distributed generation (DG) systems is to maintain the harmonic contents in output current below the specified values even when the grid is subject to uncertain disturbances such as harmonic distortion. To overcome such a challenge, an improved current control scheme is proposed for a grid-connected inverter, in which the fundamental and harmonic currents are independently controlled by a proportional-integral (PI) decoupling controller and a predictive basis controller, respectively. The controller design approach is based on the model decomposition method, where the measured inverter currents and grid voltages are divided into the fundamental and harmonic components by means of moving average filters (MAFs). Moreover, to detect the angular displacement and angular frequency with better accuracy, even in the presence of the grid disturbance, the MAF is also introduced to implement an enhanced phase-lock loop (PLL) structure. Theoretical analyses as well as comparative simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can effectively compensate the uncertainties caused by the grid voltages with fast transient response. To validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, the whole control algorithms are implemented on 2 kVA three-phase grid-connected inverter system using 32-bit floating-point DSP TMS320F28335. As a result, the proposed scheme is an attractive way to control a grid-connected inverter under adverse grid conditions. © 2016 by the authors.","Current control; Distorted grid conditions; DSP TMS320F28335; Grid-connected inverter; Model decomposition; Moving average filter","Digital arithmetic; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Harmonic analysis; Phase locked loops; Transient analysis; Two term control systems; Uncertainty analysis; DSP TMS320F28335; Grid conditions; Grid connected inverters; Model decomposition; Moving average filter; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962855618

However, NAND flash memory needs a flash translation layer (FTL) to manage its limitations such as erase before write and a limit of cell durability. To overcome these limitations, intensive FTL algorithms have been proposed considering the performance and wear leveling. However, with an increase in the popularity of the latest multi-core processors, it is important to study how multi-thread FTL can improve SSD performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-thread FTL that considers a critical region to improve the performance of NAND flash memory by taking advantage of multi-core processors. © Research India Publications.","Flash translation layer; Multi-thread; NAND flash memory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959507160

The proposed scheme is achieved by monitoring the disturbance voltage information based on the DOB. For this purpose, the DOB is implemented at the synchronous reference frame to estimate the voltage disturbances using the system input and output signals where the system inputs are the reference voltages and the system outputs are the inverter output currents. Then, the estimated disturbance voltages are transformed into the phase variables which have important information on the open-switch fault condition. By observing three-phase disturbance voltage information, the open-switch fault detection as well as faulty switch identification algorithms can be effectively realized even if the inverter has multiple (more than one) open-switch faults. Because the proposed fault detecting scheme does not require additional hardware or complex calculations, the proposed scheme can be easily applied to common electric drive systems. The reliability and feasibility of the proposed fault detection and faulty switch identification schemes have been verified through the simulation results under various open-switch fault conditions. © Research India Publications.","Disturbance observer; Fault diagnosis; Faulty switch identification; Open-switch fault; Permanent magnet synchronous motor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959454687

However, when these details are applied to coupled shear wall structures, the coupling beams' width must match the width of the walls, resulting in a complicated rebar layout and difficulty in on-site installation. Especially when applied with special shear wall structures, the joint between the coupling beam and the shear wall results in extremely complex reinforcement details that are almost impossible to install on site. With a view to overcoming such problems, this paper evaluates and reports on seismic resistance performance tests performed on coupling beams with a single diagonal reinforcement bar together with headed bars (DHB) reinforcement details, as a proposed alternative solution. Test results show that the test specimen HB75, in which the headed bars substituted for 75% of the capacity of the diagonal reinforcing bundled bars, had superior ductility and energy dissipation capability, as well as lower strength and stiffness degradation compared to other test specimens. Thus, this research indicates that the headed bars can be a practical alternative to hoops of diagonal bundled bars for confining concrete in coupling beams.",,"Concrete beams and girders; Concretes; Energy dissipation; Seismic design; Seismology; Shear walls; Alternative solutions; Energy dissipation capability; Reinforced concrete coupling; Seismic Performance; Seismic resistance performance; Shear wall structure; Strength and stiffness; Structural performance; Reinforced concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958169608

In this study, surface wettability of polycarbonate (PC) films was modified using various surface treatments: micropatterning using ultrasonic imprint lithography, fluorinate silane coating, and electron beam irradiation. To modify surface wettability selectively in a specified region, these three treatments were performed using profiled masks with the corresponding shapes. Various combinations of these treatments were investigated in terms of wettability changes, by measuring contact angle (CA). The semi-hydrophobic PC film (CA: 89.2°) was modified to create a superhydrophobic state (CA: 155.9°) by virtue of the selective micropatterning and coating. The electron beam irradiation had an opposite effect, reducing the CA (48.2°), so that the irradiated region was modified to create a hydrophilic state. Two combinations of the proposed surface modifications made it possible to have a great difference in CA on a single surface (107.7°), and to have four different wetting states on a single surface. Various water-drop experiments proved that the developed hybrid surfaces were selectively wettable and showed water-collecting capability. © 2016 by the authors.","Electron beam; Hydrophilic; Micropattern; Superhydrophobic; Ultrasonic imprinting; Water collection; Wettability","Coatings; Electron beams; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Irradiation; Surface treatment; Water conservation; Hydrophilic; Micro pattern; Superhydrophobic; Ultrasonic imprintings; Water collection; Wetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962679894

The proposed discovery protocol makes use of a short discovery code that contains compressed information of mobile applications in a device. A discovery code is generated by using either a hash function or a Bloom filter. When a device receives a discovery code broadcast by another device, the device can approximately find out the mobile applications in the other device.

While it had been considered infeasible for a long time due to strong self-interference, recent researches have made substantial progress on addressing this challenge. This paper focuses on designing full-duplex cellular networks with co-channel femtocells. Due to relatively high transmit power, cancellation of self-interference by existing techniques could still be imperfect for cellular systems and thus residual interference may impact performance significantly. To overcome this in OFDMA systems, a new radio resource management scheme assigning downlink and uplink transmissions jointly while considering the gain of self-interference cancellation is developed. Three available transmission modes of a frequency resource block and crossover points between their achievable capacities are identified for the mode selection of each resource block. Users are then assigned resource blocks and transmit power levels are determined such that the total utility sum is maximized. To handle new femtocell interference scenarios, the transmit powers of femtocells and their connected users are adjusted by a coordination algorithm such that both data transmission and mode selection of an underlying macrocell are protected. © 2015 IEEE.","Femtocell; Full-duplex radio; Heterogeneous cellular network; Simultaneous transmission and reception","Femtocell; Heterogeneous networks; Interference suppression; Mobile telecommunication systems; Natural resources management; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio transmission; Resource allocation; Wireless networks; Coordination algorithms; Full duplex communication; Full-duplex radios; Heterogeneous cellular networks; Radio resource management; Residual interference; Simultaneous transmission; Up-link transmissions; Frequency division multiple access",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978240488

A systematic numerical experiment based on explicit finite element analysis has been carried out using elastic specimens with varying elastic moduli. The soft specimen is in a compressive state even after the passage of the pulse because it cannot push the bars, such that a fairly long transmitted pulse is monitored at the gage position of the output bar. The arrival of the second pulse (tensile) from the right-end surface of the output bar releases the first transmitted signal (compressive) coming from the compressed state of the specimen, which puts an end to the fairly long transmitted pulse. Because the observation of a prolonged transmitted pulse is a natural phenomenon, the prolonged transmitted pulse should not annoy researchers in the process of confirming the validity of experiments on soft specimens. Our concern in verifying the validity of experiments can be limited to other aspects such as the process of measurement and the amplification of weak transmitted signals coming from soft specimens. © 2016, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Kolsky bar, Pulse duration time, Soft specimen, Transmitted signal","Engineering; Precision engineering; Compressive state; Explicit finite element analysis; Long pulse durations; Natural phenomena; Numerical experiments; Pulse durations; Transmitted pulse; Transmitted signal; Stress-strain curves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957959950

The objective of this research was to investigate the performance variation of this system with respect to air flow rates. CSEV system can block the contaminated air from entering the inner space by supplying fresh air horizontally in the ceilings towards the hood where the overflowed contaminated gas tends to diffuse to inner part of the room. The system captures contaminated air in an area near the ceiling and this captured air is then exhausted through the ceiling outlet. For quantitative evaluation, heat and gas capture efficiencies were defined and calculated. Experiments were conducted to compute heat and gas capture efficiencies based on the temperature and SF6 concentration data that were measured at the exhaust locations. To find optimum operation conditions for a CSEV system, numerical analysis was carried out. The numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental values. Maximum differences between the two methods are 17% for hood system and 10% for CSEV. Both heat and gas capture efficiencies would increase as exhaust flow rate of the hood increases. However, the optimum supply flow rate of ceiling nozzle was found to be 100 m3/h for maximum efficiency. This optimum flow rate condition would improve removing heat and contamination from the kitchen for better indoor air quality. © International Society of the Built Environment. © The Author(s) 2014.","Coanda effect; Concurrent supply and exhaust; Exhaust hood; Gas capture efficiency; Heat capture efficiency; Kitchen ventilation","air conditioning; air quality; airflow; Article; concurrent supply and exhaust ventilation; controlled study; heat; indoor air pollution; kitchen; mathematical analysis; priority journal; quantitative analysis; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957810436

As these parameters are uncertain, so is the evaluation of the alternatives. It is thus important to incorporate the uncertainty of flood parameters into the decision making frameworks. This research develops a spatial probabilistic multi-criteria decision making (SPMCDM) framework to demonstrate the impact of the design rainfall uncertainty on evaluation of flood management alternatives. The framework employs a probabilistic rainfall-runoff transformation model, a two-dimensional flood model and a spatial MCDM technique. Thereby, the uncertainty of decision making can be determined alongside the best alternative. A probability-based map is produced to show the discrete probability distribution function (PDF) of selecting each competing alternative. Overall the best at each grid cell is the alternative with the mode parameter of this PDF. This framework is demonstrated on the Swannanoa River watershed in North Carolina, USA and its results are compared to those of deterministic approach. While the deterministic framework fails to provide the uncertainty of selecting an alternative, the SPMCDM framework showed that in overall, selection of flood management alternatives in the watershed is ""moderately uncertain"". Moreover, three comparison metrics, F fit measure, κ statistic, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient (ρ), are computed to compare the results of these two approaches. An F fit measure of 62.6%, κ statistic of 15.4-45.0%, and spatial mean ρ value of 0.48, imply a significant difference in decision making by incorporating the design rainfall uncertainty through the presented SPMCDM framework. The SPMCDM framework can help decision makers to understand the uncertainty in selection of flood management alternatives. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Design rainfall uncertainty; Flood management; Probabilistic modeling; Spatial probabilistic multi-criteria decision making (SPMCDM); Uncertainty analysis","Distribution functions; Flood control; Floods; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Rain; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; Decision-making frameworks; Design rainfalls; Discrete probability distribution; Flood management; Multi criteria decision making; Probabilistic modeling; Rainfall-runoff transformation; Spearman rank correlation; Decision making; assessment method; decision making; flood control; probability density function; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; spatial analysis; two-dimensional modeling; uncertainty analysis; North Carolina; Swannanoa River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951954343

The loading conditions that are evaluated include global bending moment, axial tension, and internal pressure. In terms of geometries, the geometric variables affecting the SIFs and the elastic CODs of complex-cracked pipes, i.e., the crack angle of throughwall cracks (TWCs), the crack depth of fully circumferential, internal surface cracks in the inner surface of pipe, and the ratio of pipe mean radius to thickness, are systematically considered in the present FE analyses. The FE analysis procedure employed in the present study has been validated against the existing solutions for the circumferential TWC pipes. Using the present FE results, the shape factors of SIF and elastic COD for complex-cracked pipes are tabulated as a function of geometric variables. The results are applied for closed-form expressions of SIF and elastic COD when the pipe is subjected to simple loading conditions of bending, axial tension, or internal pressure. The proposed closed-form expressions can estimate SIF and elastic COD of complex-cracked pipes within maximum differences of 2.4% and 5.9% with FE results, respectively.

This paper presents a method of directly measuring the effective spring constant of a colloidal probe by the reference cantilever method. The distinctive feature of the reference cantilever method in this study is that the reference cantilever has a tip. The tip determines the location of the loading point on the reference cantilever and enables detecting the loading point on the colloidal probe's cantilever by monitoring the change in a force distance curve depending on the contact point between a spherical particle and the tip. The effective spring constants of the colloidal probes measured by the proposed method are compared to those determined by finite element analysis (FEA). The importance of calibrating the effective spring constant of the colloidal probe in applied forces and mechanical tests is investigated by comparing force distance curves and nanometer-scale wear test results obtained at two different spring constant settings. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Colloidal probe; Contact load; Finite element analysis; Force-distance curve; Spring constant; Tribological test","Gears; Loads (forces); Nanocantilevers; Probes; Springs (components); Colloidal probes; Contact load; Force-distance curves; Spring constants; Tribological tests; Finite element method; analytic method; Article; atomic force microscopy; calibration; colloid; finite element analysis; force; investigative procedures; mechanical stimulus test; molecular probe; priority journal; reference cantilever method; surface property; thickness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946429508

For this purpose, new terephthalaldehyde (TPA) and conventional glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linkers are adopted on a glucose oxidase (GOx), polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT)(GOx/PEI/CNT) structure. GOx/PEI/CNT cross-linked by TPA (TPA/[GOx/PEI/CNT]) results in a superior EBC performance and stability to other catalysts. It is attributed to the π bonds conjugated between the aldehyde of TPA and amine of the GOx/PEI molecules. By π conjugation, electrons bonded with carbon and nitrogen are delocalized, promoting the electron transfer and catalytic activity with an excellent EBC performance. The maximum power density (MPD) of an EBC adopting TPA/[GOx/PEI/CNT] (0.66 mW cm-2) is far better than that of the other EBCs (the MPD of EBC adopting GOx/PEI/CNT is 0.40 mW cm-2). Regarding stability, the covalent bonding formed between TPA and GOx/PEI plays a critical role in preventing the denaturation of GOx molecules, leading to an excellent stability.

The depth-controlled Si-μH arrays were fabricated by using the deep reactive ion etching method. The ZnO NRs were grown along the Si-μH surface, in holes deeper than 20 μm. The polymer layer, polydimethylsiloxane, which acts a stress diffuser and electrical insulator, was successfully penetrated into the deep Si-μH arrays. Optical investigations show that the crystalline quality of the ZnO NRs on the Si-μH arrays was not degraded, even though they were grown on the deeper Si-μH arrays. As the depth of the Si-μH arrays increase from 0 to 20 μm, the output voltage was enhanced by around 8.1 times while the current did not increase. Finally, an output power enhancement of ten times was obtained. This enhancement of the output power was consistent with the increase in the surface area, and was mainly attributed to the accumulation of the potentials generated by the series-connected ZnO NR-based nanogenerators, whose number increases as the depth of the Si-μH increases. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","nanogenerator; piezoelectric; Si microhole array; ZnO nanorod","Nanorods; Nanotechnology; Piezoelectricity; Reactive ion etching; Silicones; Zinc oxide; Deep Reactive Ion Etching; Electrical insulators; Micro-hole arrays; Nanogenerator; Optical investigation; piezoelectric; Piezoelectric nanogenerator; ZnO nanorod; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954571466

The railway facility areas located in South Korea are considered significant non-point source pollution. Therefore, the method of managing non-point source pollution in the railway areas is crucial. This study was conducted to quantify the first flush in the railway bridge area and to suggest the method of reducing the pollution level of the facilities that create non-point source pollution. The first-flush criteria are analyzed using the volume ratio method, the dynamic event mean concentration method, and the mass first-flush ratio method. As a result of an effective rainfall analysis, the first-flush effective rainfall depths were determined to be 8.4 mm in the concrete roadbed area and 16.5 mm in the gravel roadbed area. These first-flush rainfall depths are greater than the sizing criteria (5 mm) of best management practices (BMPs) for capturing first flush in South Korea. Thus, a rigorous rainfall-runoff management is required in the gravel roadbed area. This study implies that BMP must be properly installed upon consideration on the characteristics of the railway facility areas, which have rarely received attention as a significant non-point source as opposed to paved urban areas such as parking lots and roadways. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

However, the research on the railway facilities has been inadequate. The interest on non-point source pollution is increasing in an effort to protect the quality of the water system. In this study, the data of the concrete road-beds on railway bridges, the runoff characteristics, event mean concentration (EMC), and pollutant load per unit area were assessed. The railway bridge concrete road-bed areas typically show the first-flush effect, whereas the railway bridge gravel road-bed areas show a two-peak effect on the runoff characteristics of non-point source pollution. The pollutant unit load and EMC in the concrete road-bed areas have also been found to be higher than those in gravel road-bed areas. The pollutant load per unit area around railway facilities shows more non-point source pollutants than other areas. The values of heavy metals and oil and grease (O&G) pollutants more washed out than heavy metals and O&G pollutants in the pavement and urban areas. The non-point source pollutants are the main type of the pollutants around the railway facilities.

The reliability of electricity supply is characterized almost exclusively by shortage costs. This study employs input-output analysis to measure the electricity shortage costs in Korea and determine the optimal way in which limited electric power resources can be allocated to various sectors while maximizing the total value added. The results indicate that the marginal cost of unsupplied electricity ranged from KRW 147 to KRW 5,891 per kWh and that these total costs depended not only on the shortage percentage of each non-electricity sector but also on the level of its final demand.

Voids were formed in the Cu layer because of Cu atoms diffusing through the thin Ag layer to be oxidized in the upper Cu2O aggregates. After being heated to 250 °C, the Ag layer became more irregular, and in some regions, it disappeared because of intensive dewetting. The number and average size of the voids also increased.

Recently, as vehicle becomes more electrified thanks to progress of battery technology and increased efficiency of downsized engine, there have been many studies on PHEV system. For developing efficient PHEV system, it is important to optimize vehicle powertrain configuration and also powertrain structure of the configuration should be feasible in practical view. This paper concerns design and analysis of the new PHEV powertrain. In the previous study, new PHEV powertrain configurations is designed by adding clutch or changing clutch location in the existing PHEV configuration to use electric motors more actively. Proposed powertrain structure could use two electric motors and an internal combustion engine for propelling vehicle. In this study, the new PHEV powertrain structure is designed. The new powertrain structure has disadvantage of increased weight and volume, however diverse operating mode is possible, thus entire vehicle system’s efficiency could be increased. Engine mode, single motor electric vehicle (EV) mode, two motor EV mode, 3 hybrid mode could be operated in the new powertrain system structure. Powertrain’s gear ratio for each operating mode is considered when designing new powertrain structure. New powertrain configuration is modeled and validated using backward-looking simulation. Optimal component sizing is conducted to raise vehicle’s fuel economy performance using dynamic programming. Structure design of the new PHEV powertrain and vehicle simulation results present validation of newly proposed vehicle system and shows that the improved fuel economy performance could be acquired. © 2016, FISITA.

But this method cannot match the 6 DOF posture of manipulator to robot if the length and size of the manipulator and the robot are not identical. Since the precise alignment between upper and lower plate is very critical during surgical operation, the posture based control of Stewart Platform is necessary. In this study, the posture based control algorithm is proposed in order to align the upper and lower plate of robot with those of manipulator precisely. Also, this approach was theoretically simulated by MATLAB, as well as verified by experiment. © Research India Publications.","Forward/inverse kinematics; Orthopedic surgical robot; Posture based control algorithm; Stewart platform",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026741956

Therefore, adapting to the changing climate is an immediate challenge that requires choosing a successful strategy. This chapter reviews classical decision-making methods and discusses their limitations when applied to climate change adaptation planning. Three novel decision-making methods, robust decision making (RDM), real option analysis (ROA), and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP), are discussed, and their applications are then introduced in water resources planning under different climate change scenarios. Such methods should be either “robust” or “adaptive” for decision makers to capture the nonstationary and uncertain characteristics of climate change. As its name indicates, the RDM method focuses on the “robust” perspective and chooses an alternative that performs satisfactorily over a wide range of scenarios. In contrast, both the ROA and DAPP methods focus on the “adaptive” perspective and have a decision tree framework where risk is spread over time. ROA allows decision makers to delay or abandon the chosen alternative rather than just implementing it without modification, while DAPP introduces the tipping point concept that offers a systematic way of when to switch between alternatives. However, these advanced decision-making methods are resource intensive; thus, a continuous administrative effort and institutional as well as technical supports are required for their success in the climate change era. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.","Adaptation; Climate change; Decision making; Dynamic adaptive policy pathways; Real options; Robust decision making","Decision making; Decision trees; Greenhouse gases; Water resources; Adaptation; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Climate change scenarios; Dynamic-adaptive; Real Options; Robust decisions; Water resources planning; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018602558

In this paper, we present a development approach of a four-wheel omnidirectional mobile robot using mecanum wheels for directional flexibility and the recently standardized fieldbus, EtherCAT, for performing control instructions within the network. We implemented an open source EtherCAT master stack with a dual kernel real-time approach, Xenomai, configured to run alongside standard Linux on an embedded board to meet the real-time requirements of a main controller. The main controller schedules and executes multiple periodic tasks such as recognition of the target position, computation of the velocity commands to navigate along a target trajectory, and running the actual control task of servo drives. Feasibility of the EtherCAT solution for the mobile robot controller is determined thorough a statistical analysis in terms of periodicity of control task, corresponding jitter, and execution time. Actuation of the mobile robot is performed by implementing a proven trajectory planning algorithm considering the physical limits of the system to generate velocity commands that could track an S-curve path. Finally, accuracy of the mobile robot is determined by analyzing the encoder feedback and is represented in Cartesian space. © Research India Publications.","EtherCAT; Mecanum Wheels; Omnidirectional Mobile Robot; Real-time System; Xenomai",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018288580

The primary purpose of topology control ensures the connectivity of wireless nodes participated in the network. Low-power Internet of Things communication networks look like wireless network environments in which the main communication devices are wireless devices with limited energy like battery. In this paper, we propose a distributed topology control algorithm by merging the combinatorial block design from a design theory with the multiples of 2. The proposed technique especially focuses on asynchronous and asymmetric neighbor discovery. The concept of block design is used to generate the neighbor discovery schedule when a target duty cycle is given. In addition, the multiples of 2 are applied to overcome the challenge of the block design and support asymmetric operation. We analyze the worst case discovery latency and energy consumption numerically by calculating the total number of slots and wake-up slots based on the given duty cycle. It shows that our proposed method has the smallest total number of slots and wake-up slots among existing representative neighbor discovery protocols. The numerical analysis represents the proposed technique find neighbors quickly with minimum battery power compared with other protocols for distributed topology control. For future research direction, we could perform a simulation study or real experiment to investigate the best parameter for choosing the multiple of a certain number. © 2017 IEEE.","Asymmetric duty cycle; Asynchronous neighbor discovery; Internet of things; Low-power IoT communication; Machine to machine communications","Automation; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; Machine-to-machine communication; Topology; Wakes; Wireless networks; Communication device; Duty-cycle; Future research directions; Low Power; Neighbor discovery; Neighbor discovery protocol; Topology control algorithms; Wireless network environment; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015171373

The precipitation of carbide or nitride via the addition of micro-alloying elements, because it reduced prior austenite grain size upon austenitization, promoted transformation of austenite to ferrite and increased flow stress. The strain-induced precipitation under deformation in the two-phase region, on the other hand, increased the flow stress when the micro-alloying elements were dissolved during austenitization.

Plots of the interface movement distance against time were obtained. The solid-liquid interface of the nonfaceted phase is atomically rough; it migrates in continuous mode, giving smooth curves of the distance-time plot. This is the case for pivalic acid and camphene. It was expected that the faceted phases would show different types of curves of the distance-time plot because of the atomically smooth solid-liquid interface. However, salol (faceted phase) shows a curve of the distance-time plot as smooth as that of the nonfaceted phases. This indicates that the solid-liquid interface of salol migrates as continuously as that of the nonfaceted phases.

For instance, it should not be possible to restore deleted secure data, even when the gadgets are hacked through unauthorized access. The existing tools operating on hard disks guarantee reliable data deletion by overwriting secure files multiple times. However, this method does not operate correctly in mobile gadgets using NAND flash memory as storage media, because they apply out-of-place update and the old data remain unmodified even when overwritten. To address this problem while incurring only a low overhead, in this paper the design of a reliable data deletion scheme based on the hybrid mapping flash translation layer that delivers high performance with low memory usage is described. The basic concept is to count the overwrite operations of a logical block and eliminate all the old data when the count exceeds a threshold. The high scattering degree of a logical block that causes a significant overhead of erasing the old data is mitigated by adopting an active log pool. A trace-driven evaluation shows that the proposed scheme delivers a 12.4-22.3% better performance than that of an existing scheme that supports reliable data deletion. The additional memory consumption is 512 KB in a 32 GB partition and 1.12 MB in a 70 GB partition, which is not significant. © Research India Publications.","Active log pool; Flash translation layer; NAND flash memory; Reliable data deletion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011835166

However, the LID control module should be repeatedly simulated to develop the detailed design concept. Therefore, Water Management Analysis Module (WMAM), an effective decision support system (DSS) based on EPA SWMM5.1 for LID designing and planning was developed. In this study, the developed WMAM is applied to a case study in Korea to show the effectiveness and usefulness of it. WMAM can simulate multiple-scenarios of water management facilities as well as design and planning parameters, simultaneously, in a selected sub-catchment. By using its sensitivity analysis, it finds several powerful parameters among various LID design parameters. Moreover, it generates and simulates multiple scenarios of the watershed management facility’s design and planning parameters, and it provides the most effective scenario for LID design and planning parameters in the hydrologic aspect.

The result of analysis is as follows. First, tax practitioners have higher tendency of tax justice than tax professors so they believed that clergy taxation should be introduced. Second, the more career experience they have the higher their tendency of tax justice, so, they believed that tax should be imposed equally on religious people as other workers. Third, the more religious belief the respondents had the more they are likely to be against clergy taxation.

A technique to generate central velocity commands using a convolution operator that considers only the physical limits of a mobile robot was discussed. In practical application, controlling the heading angles along a curved path is required and the existence of obstacles is inevitable. First, we suggested an algorithm that generates a trajectory to consider the heading angles along a smooth Bezier curve by redefinition of the curve parameter. However, the presence of an obstacle along the planned path requires redirection to a new path where geometrical limitations such as high curvature turning points exist, resulting in tracking error. We propose a method that manages a variation of linear interpolation to generate a feasible trajectory while conserving the high curvature path and the merits of convolution. Joint-space trajectories are produced by scaling down the generated central velocity through reduction of the given maximum velocity limit. We show through a simulation example that the proposed method is able to generate a trajectory that can accurately track a planned path on a designed platform based on actual parameters. Finally, an experiment is successfully conducted on a two-wheeled mobile robot, Tetra DS-III, in a real-time control system. The experiment results display distinct advantages in the criteria of time optimality and periodicity of control tasks, while conserving all possible limitations that could occur during navigation compared with previous studies. © 2016 Author(s).

Common rail pressure control and injector driving systems are both essential for injecting fuel at a controlled pressure. With various duty ratios of the square wave generated from the CCP (capture compare PWM) pin of a microprocessor to the common rail pressure controller, the common rail pressure can be controlled continuously. An increase of the duty ratio of the supplied PWM square wave decreases the common rail pressure. The common rail pressure is controlled at 600, 1000, and 1500 bars. Moreover, a solenoid-type common rail injector driver was developed using a microprocessor. In order to drive the common rail injector, the current in the solenoid should be controlled using what is known as a peak and hold pattern, which consists of a high current level with a short time duration (peak) in the first step and a low current level with a long time duration (hold) in the subsequent step. The CCP pin in the microprocessor was used to generate the peak and hold current pattern. The PWM square wave generated from the CCP pin has a duty ratio of 100% of the PWM square wave for the peak current, with ratios of 10%, 20%, and 30% for the hold pattern.

The gains of controller are determined by a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based optimization so that the convergence rate to the steady state is maximized in the presence of the uncertainties in the LC filter.

The specimens containing micro-alloying elements had smaller prior austenite grain sizes than those of the other specimens, presumably due to the pinning effect of the formation of carbonitrides and AlN precipitates at the austenite grain boundaries. The high-temperature compressive deformation test results indicate that dynamic recrystallization behavior was suppressed in the specimens with micro-alloying elements, particularly at increased strain rate, because of the pinning effect of precipitates, grain boundary dragging and lattice misfit effects of solute atoms, although the strength increased with increasing strain rate. © Materials Research Society of Korea, All rights reserved.","Micro-alloying elements; Recrystallization behavior; Reheating temperature; Steels; Strain rate","Alloying elements; Aluminum nitride; Austenite; Carbon; Carbon steel; Crystal microstructure; Deformation; Dynamic recrystallization; Grain boundaries; III-V semiconductors; Industrial heating; Microalloying; Steel; Steel research; AlN precipitates; Austenite grain boundaries; Chemical compositions; High temperature compressive deformations; Micro-alloying elements; Prior austenite grain size; Reheating temperature; Steel specimens; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997077922

The choice of an optimal output voltage vector is made first from the 6 possible active voltage vectors of the 2-level voltage source inverter. Then a modulation factor for the chosen optimal voltage vector is obtained so that the torque ripple can be reduced further.

A thermal camera can be an alternative to this in smoky situations and is capable of detecting people from their emitted thermal energy. On the other hand, the thermal image camera has a smaller field of view than an ordinary camera due to its lens characteristics and temperature error, etc. In order to cover a relatively wide area, panoramic image construction needs to be implemented.

This study also reviews the ratio of equity value to the NAV of a fund for research purposes. The tax basis ratio of a pension fund is higher than that of a general fund. A pension fund manager tends to employ a fund management strategy that does not focus on the reduction of tax burdens on fund investors compared with a general fund manager. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that a pension fund manager is less sensitive to the increased tax burden on a fund investor, because pension income is taxed at a lower rate than dividend.

However, their intrinsically low mechanical stability has been a major obstacle for practical applications that require repeated use and in wet and humid environments. Herein, we show a method that can recover the clustered or deformed HAR nanopillars to their original shapes by taking advantage of the mechanical compliance of the nanopillars toward pulling during a demolding process. The pillars can be repeatedly clustered and recovered many times. Our method is simple yet powerful to recover the clustered nanopillars over a large area (7 × 10 cm2). By taking advantage of the different optical properties of the clustered pillars vs. the straight ones, we demonstrate display and erasing of patterns and tunable wettability by stamping the nanopillars to induce clustering, followed by shape recovery via demolding of the pillars. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Aspect ratio; Energy harvesting; Mechanical stability; Optical properties; Recovery; Shape optimization; Wetting; High aspect ratio; High compliances; Humid environment; Large surface area; Mechanical compliance; Nanopillars; Shape recovery; Tunable wettabilities; Nanostructures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991632814

A one-pad top foil forms the bearing surface, under which the bearing structure and a bearing housing are located. Test bearings include gas foil bearings (GFBs), gas polymer bearings (GPBs), and gas foil-polymer bearings (GFPBs). In addition, three metal shims were employed to create wedge effects in the GFPBs. Firstly, static load-deflection tests of test bearings estimate the radial assembly clearance, which is measured to be ∼200 μm. Secondly, shake dynamic loading tests identify frequency-dependent dynamic characteristics. An electromagnetic shaker provides flat bearing specimens with one-degree-of-freedom vertical dynamic loading at excitation frequencies reaching 800 Hz. The bearing structures of GFB, GPB, and GFPB were measured to have resonance frequencies near 200 Hz. The GFPB has the lowest stiffness coefficients, which also increased with increasing excitation frequency. In addition, it has higher loss factor than those of GFB, which decreases with increasing excitation frequency. Therefore, GFPB was measured to exhibit a higher structural damping and lower stiffness than GFB. Lastly, the electric motor driving tests examine the rotordynamic stability performance. A permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor drives a PM rotor supported on a pair of test journal bearings. The rotor has a diameter of 40 mm, length of 240 mm, and weight of 19.6 N. Two orthogonally positioned displacement sensors record the horizontal and vertical rotor motions. Test results indicate that sub-synchronous rotor motions for GFPBs showed the lowest amplitudes < 28 μm with the WFRs ∼0.14, and operated up to the highest rotating speed of 85 krpm with the OSS of 69 krpm, compared to GFBs and GPBs. In addition, the effects of mechanical preload and bearing clearance on the rotordynamic performance are examined for GFPBs. As a result, the GFPBs with mechanical preloads enhanced the rotordynamic performance with no subsynchronous motions up to the maximum rotor speed of 88 krpm, and the bearing friction characteristics as well. Furthermore, they showed comparable rotordynamic performance to three-pad GFBs from a past literature, even with larger bearing clearances and small mechanical preloads.

Of particular interest is the measurement of the RF conductivity of a flexible Zell fabric, which is often used to implement wearable antennas on clothes. First, the transmission coefficient is measured using a planar microstrip ring resonator, where the ring is made of a Zell fabric. Then, the fabric's conductivity is determined by comparing the measured transmission coefficient to a set of simulation data. Specifically, a MATLABbased root-searching algorithm is used to find the minimum of an error function composed of measured and simulation data. Several error functions have been tested, and the results showed that an error function employing only the magnitude of the transmission coefficient was the best for determining the conductivity. The effectiveness of this technique is verified by the measurement of a known copper foil before characterizing the Zell fabric. The conductivity of the Zell fabric at 2 GHz appears to be within the order of 104 S/m, which is lower than the DC conductivity of 5×105 S/m. © The Korean Institute of Electromagnetic Engineering and Science.

A test FPSE, composed of two pistons and spring elements, is designed by drawing root locus trajectories from linear eigenvalue analysis. Piston springs are developed by using finite element stress analyses and validated through static load-deflection tests. An experimental test rig for a manufactured FPSE includes ceramic heater, water cooler, and external dashpot. Tests are conducted with the atmospheric air at increasing heater temperatures under no load and external load conditions. Firstly, no load tests at increasing heater temperatures show significant increases in both piston stroke and pressure amplitude, but negligible changes in working frequency. Pressure-volume (P-V) power and thermal efficiency also increase significantly. Interestingly, dynamic discontinuities occur during continuous variations of heater temperature, demonstrating sudden increases in engine performance as well as operation uncertainty. Besides, cooling flow rate is found to have minimal influence on engine performance. Secondly, external load tests for increasing damping loads demonstrate considerable decreases in piston stroke, pressure amplitude and P-V power, but negligible changes in working frequency; while shaft power increases then decreases having an optimal operating load. Finally, the test FPSE is turned out to adapt itself to variations in heater temperatures and external loads by changing piston strokes and their phase angle.

This study investigates the relationship between tax rate and tax revenue using the data for the 34 countries from OECD tax database between 1981 and 2015. And this study executes nonlinear regression analysis in order to analyze the relationship. The result is that the national openness measured by the scale of the overseas trade weakens the positive (+) relationship between the corporate tax rate and the corporate tax revenue. This proves that the increase in corporate tax rate might not lead to the increase in the corporate tax revenue as the amount of the overseas trade gets larger. In the current world's economic condition where the trade between multinational corporates and countries are active, the main conclusion is that the tax policy of raising the corporate tax rate to secure the corporate tax revenue can rather lead to the result of failing to secure the corporate tax revenue. © 2016 Sung Man Yoon and Yeyoung Moon.","Tax rate; Tax rate raising policy; Tax revenue; Welfare expenditure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991035766

First, in spite of the heterogeneity of agents' dynamics, we show that strong coupling among agents makes the trajectories of all agents arbitrarily close to the averaged dynamics. Second, in the averaged dynamics, the effect of variations in each agent gets smaller as the number of agents increases.

In order to obtain high power factor, a boost PFC cell is operated in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with a fixed switching frequency according to the load condition. For the ripple-free output current, a buck inductor is replaced with a coupled inductor and an auxiliary capacitor. The boost PFC cell and the buck converter share a main switch and a self-driven synchronous rectifier (SR). By turning the SR off after a short delay, the main switch is turned on under zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) condition. Since the conduction loss on the SR is reduced and there is no switching loss on the main switch, the power-conversion efficiency is improved. The maximum efficiency of the proposed converter 93.37% is measured at 130vac. To verify the performance of the proposed converter, theoretical analyses, design procedures, and experimental results from a 80V and 100W prototype are presented. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Power-Factor-Correction (PFC); Single-Stage converter; Synchronous rectifier; Zero-Voltage-Switching (ZVS)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989260392

The maximum tensile stress was concentrated on the Al pad and the interface between the low-k layer and Al pad, which were the possible sites for crack initiation and delamination. In order to prevent the low-k failure, the effects of five parameters on the low-k layer stress were systematically investigated, which were the under bump metallization (UBM) diameter, die thickness, die size, coefficient of temperature expansion (CTE) of the substrate core, and diameter of the solder resist opening. Numerical simulation results indicated that larger UBM, thinner die and lower CTE core materials were beneficial for reducing the stress on the low-k layer. Application of the optimized parameters reduced the low-k layer stress by 50%.

The NiO morphology of the pH-7.0 and pH-10.0 samples exhibited a large size plate owing to the slow reaction of the hydroxide (OH-) and nickel ions (Ni+) in lower pH than pH-11.5.

CaO-SiO2system has been known as a bioactive material that has an ability to form apatite on the surface of the bones inside the body fluid. Applications of biomaterials could require the use of excess amount of antibiotics during transplantation to prevent any infections or microbism. Ag ion has been known for its unique biological properties of antibiosis. We already reported that CaO-SiO2gels prepared by a sol-gel method can be used as inorganic fillers for osteoconductive composites because they showed apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid. In this study, we synthesized 30CaO70SiO2(CS) gel powders modified with Ag ions ranging from 0 to 100 ppm to provide antibacterial property. Using the Ag-modified CS powders, composites were prepared by combining with polyetheretherketone (PEEK), which was used as a polymer matrix. Apatite formation in a simulated body fluid was observed on all the composites regardless of Ag contents. The composites consisting of CS modified with Ag ions suppressed multiplication of E.coli.

Three novel complexes prepared and characterized are [(Hpmide)2Ni3(CH3COO)4] (1), [(Hpmide)2Co3(CH3COO)4] (2), and [(pmidip)2Co3(CH3COO)4] (3). In 1 and 2, two terminal nickel(ii)/cobalt(ii) units are coordinated to one Hpmide- and two CH3CO2-.

The optical mouse sensor is convenient and cost-effective for the coordinate estimation problem. It is possible to overcome the position estimation error caused by the slip and the model mismatch of robot's motion equation using the optical mouse sensor. One of the simple methods for the position estimation using the optical mouse sensor is integration of the velocity data from the sensor with time. However, the unavoidable noise in the sensor data may deteriorate the position estimation in case of the simple integration method. In general, a mobile robot has ready-to-use motion information from the encoder sensors of driving motors. By combining the velocity data from the optical mouse sensor and the motion information of a mobile robot, it is possible to improve the coordinate estimation performance. In this paper, a coordinate estimation algorithm for an autonomous mobile robot is presented based on the well-known Kalman filter that is useful to combine the different types of sensors. Computer simulation results show the performance of the proposed localization algorithm for several types of trajectories in comparison with the simple integration method.","Kalman filter algorithm; Mobile robot localization; Optical mouse sensor","Cost effectiveness; Data integration; Equations of motion; Integration; Kalman filters; Mammals; Mobile robots; Navigation; Robot applications; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Autonomous navigation; Coordinate estimation; Kalman filter algorithms; Localization algorithm; Mobile robot localization; Optical mouse sensors; Position estimation; Robots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986182676

The coated SiC powders were prepared by thermal curing and pyrolysis of PCS. Thermal curing at 200 °C was performed to fabricate infusible materials prior to pyrolysis. The cured powders were heated treated up to 1600 °C for the pyrolysis process and for the formation of SiC crystals on the surface of the SiC powders. XRD analysis revealed that the main peaks corresponded to the α-SiC phase; peaks for β-SiC were newly appeared. The formation of β-SiC is explained by the transformation of thermally-cured PCS on the surface of the initial α-SiC powders. Using powder mixtures of coated SiC powder, hydrogen-reduced Cu-nitrate, and elemental Cu powders, Cu-SiC composites were fabricated by pressureless sintering at 1000 °C. Microstructural observation for the sintered composites showed that the powder mixture of PCS-coated SiC and Cu exhibited a relatively dense and homogeneous microstructure. Conversely, large pores and separated interfaces between Cu and SiC were observed in the sintered composite using uncoated SiC powders.

Although the stacking fault energy, calculated using a modified thermodynamic model, slightly decreased with increasing grain size, it was found to vary in a range of 23.4 mJ/m2 to 27.1 mJ/m2. Room-temperature tensile test results indicated that the yield and tensile strengths increased; the ductility also improved as the grain size decreased. The increase in the yield and tensile strengths was primarily attributed to the occurrence of mechanical twinning, as well as to the grain refinement effect. On the other hand, the improvement of the ductility is because the formation of deformation-induced martensite is suppressed in the high-manganese steel specimen with small grain size during tensile testing. The deformationinduced martensite transformation resulting from the increased grain size can be explained by the decrease in stacking fault energy or in shear stress required to generate deformation-induced martensite transformation. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Austenitic; Deformation-induced martensite transformation; Grain size; High-manganese steel; Tensile properties","Austenite; Austenitic transformations; Deformation; Ductility; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Manganese; Martensite; Martensitic steel; Shear stress; Stainless steel; Steel; Steel research; Steel testing; Tensile properties; Tensile testing; Austenitic; Austenitic high manganese steels; Deformation-induced martensite; Grain refinement effects; Grain size; High manganese steel; Stacking fault energies; Yield and tensile strength; Tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983499589

The fabricated Cu particles exhibited a polygonal shape and a smooth surface; the Cu@Ag particles prepared without a reductant showed tiny bumps lightly formed on the surfaces; and the Cu@Ag particles fabricated with an L-ascorbic acid indicated very rough surfaces. The Ag shell in the particles fabricated without a reductant was thinner than that in the particles fabricated with the reductant. In the as-pelletized samples, the sample containing the particles fabricated with the reductant exhibited a slightly high electrical resistivity; the slight change in the resistivity was interpreted in terms of difference in the contact area between the particles after pelletization. The as-pelletized samples after oxidation showed a striking difference in the resistivities of pure Cu particles and the Cu@Ag particles fabricated without a reductant. However, the Cu@Ag particles fabricated with the reductant presented a nearly consistent resistivity with a superior antioxidation property. When the resistivities of the films was measured after curing the paste co-containing micron-sized Cu@Ag flakes and submicron particles, it was confirmed that the pure Cu particles and Cu@Ag particles prepared without a reductant are oxidized in the paste during curing. In contrast, the paste containing Cu@Ag particles fabricated with the reductant presented the lowest resistivities, which were 2.85 × 10−3and 8.90 × 10−4 Ω cm in air and nitrogen, respectively, indicating the strongest antioxidation behavior than the other pastes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical transport; Oxidation; Powder metallurgy; Surface and interfaces; Thermal analysis","Ascorbic acid; Curing; Fabrication; Oxidation; Pelletizing; Powder metallurgy; Thermoanalysis; Anti-oxidation properties; Characterization methods; Conductive fillers; Electrical transport; High-electrical resistivities; Polygonal shapes; Sub-micron particles; Surface and interfaces; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982207571

Since the positively charged grain boundary core is intensified with a high local concentration of defects such as oxygen vacancies, uniform distribution of a dopant may mitigate the formation of space charge layers and enhance the ionic conductivity. To investigate the dopant segregation effect on the space charge layer and ionic conductivity, we provided thermal energy to nanocrystalline gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) thin film by post-annealing at different temperatures of 700°C, 900°C, and 1100°C. STEM-EELS analysis demonstrates strong dopant segregation and a higher Ce3+ content near the grain boundary than in the bulk after post-annealing. The concurrent segregation of dopants and Ce3+ ions implies that once thermal treatment is applied to nanocrystalline GDC thin films, complete space charge layers are formed while the non-thermally treated GDC film with a uniform distribution of dopants has less of a space charge effect and exhibits superior ionic conductivity. © 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

Two analysis methods were applied: motion analysis using motion-capture cameras and analysis of muscle activity using an electromyogram (EMG) analysis system.. From analysis of the data, the following conclusions were drawn.First, snowboarding posture training in simulators helps improve riding angulation (tilting using ankle flexion). Second, practicing snowboard riding on horizontal simulators before riding on slopes, taking into account the difficulty of training motions and participants’ level of proficiency in them, is desirable. Third, during practice of snowboard riding motions using simulators, instructors should continuously evaluate and correct participants’ posture to prevent excessive hip-joint flexion during FS turns.Fourth, most muscles showed higher activity levels during snowboard riding on slopes than in simulators.

Herbal remedies were selected by translating the symptom terminology into westernized medicinal terms using the Korean classification of disease in Oriental medicine and Korea Traditional Knowledge Portal. Seven types of herb extracts were selected and screened for in vitro anti-hypertensive activities. Among the extracts, those of Evodiae fructus, Bambusae caulis in Taeniam, Sophorae fructus, Melonis calyx, and Schizonepeta rhizome produced significant increases in NO production, although their ability to inhibit ACE were weaker.

Serration appeared right after yield stress at lower strain rates, while it was hardly observed at high strain rates. On the other hand, strain-rate sensitivity, indicating a general relationship between flow stress and strain rate at constant strain and temperature, changed from positive to negative as the strain increased. The negative strain-rate sensitivity can be explained by the Portevin Le Chatelier effect, which is associated with dynamic strain aging and is dependent on the strain rate because it is very likely that the dynamic strain aging phenomenon in high-manganese steels is involved in the interaction between moving dislocations and point-defect complexes. © Materials Research Society of Korea.","Dynamic strain aging; High-manganese steel; Serrated plastic flow; Strain-rate sensitivity; Tensile properties","Iron compounds; Manganese; Plastic flow; Point defects; Steel; Stress-strain curves; Tensile properties; Tensile testing; Yield stress; Constant strains; Dynamic strain aging; High manganese steel; High strain rates; Moving dislocation; Portevin-Le Chatelier effects; Strain rate sensitivity; Stress and strain rate; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976439401

The sensing mechanism of Cu2+by 1 were proposed to be a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) with the experimental results and theoretical calculations, and that of S2−by 1 proposed to be a deprotonation process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Colorimetric; Copper; Naked-eye; Sulfide","copper; sulfide; absorption; aqueous solution; Article; association constant; binding affinity; calculation; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemosensor; colorimetry; column chromatography; electrospray mass spectrometry; limit of detection; pH; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; room temperature; sensor; substitution reaction; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975795242

The electrocatalytic activity and stability in fuel cells largely depend on the surface morphology and structure of the support. In this study, Ru and RuO2 nanofibers prepared by electrospinning and post-calcination have been considered as Pt-catalyst supports. The composite material loaded with 20 wt% Pt catalyst exhibited a high anodic current density of 641.7 mA mgPt-1, a high IF/IB ratio of 1.9, and excellent electrocatalytic stability compared to commercial Pt/C. The improved anodic current density of the composite is attributed to the high dispersion of the Pt catalyst over the large surface area of the nanosized support grains, while its low onset potential, high IF/IB ratio, and excellent electrocatalytic stability are ascribed to a bifunctional effect resulting from the existence of Ru atoms on the support surface. Finally, the efficient electron transfer and a rapid diffusion rate of the electrolyte are due to the unique network structure of the supports. Thus, the Ru and RuO2 nanofiber composites act as promising Pt-catalyst supports for the methanol oxidation reaction. © 2016 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973604740

In this light, we propose a new type of artificial spiking neuron based on leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) behavior. A distinctive feature of the proposed FG-LIF neuron is the use of a floating-gate (FG) integrator rather than a capacitor-based one. The relaxation time of the charge on the FG relies mainly on the tunnel barrier profile, e.g., barrier height and thickness (rather than the area). This opens up the possibility of large-scale integration of neurons. The circuit simulation results offered biologically plausible spiking activity (<100 Hz) with a capacitor of merely 6 fF, which is hosted in an FG metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. The FG-LIF neuron also has the advantage of low operation power (<30 pW/spike). Finally, the proposed circuit was subject to possible types of noise, e.g., thermal noise and burst noise. The simulation results indicated remarkable distributional features of interspike intervals that are fitted to Gamma distribution functions, similar to biological neurons in the neocortex. © 2016 Kornijcuk, Lim, Seok, Kim, Kim, Kim, Choi and Jeong.","Floating-gate integrator; Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron; Spatial integration; Spiking neural network; Synaptic transistor","Article; artificial neural network; calculation; controlled study; electric field; electron; human; human cell; mathematical analysis; neocortex; nerve cell; simulation; synapse; synaptic transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973532127

The constraints used in determining the best locations include circuit breaker fault current limits, proximity of proposed locations, and capability of the solution to reach power flow convergence. A simple power injection model after applying line-opening on selected branches was used as a means for power flows with BtB converters.

Manual data collection measurement methods have been automated through the use of various wireless or wired sensors. Single sensor devices are included in smart devices such as smartphones. Data transmission is critical for big data collected from sensor nodes, such as Mobile Sensor Nodes (MSNs), where sensors move dynamically according to sensor mobility, or Fixed Sensor Nodes (FSNs), where sensor locations are decided by the users. False data transfer processing of big data results in topology lifespan reduction and data transfer delays. Hence, a variety of simulators and diverse load-balancing algorithms have been developed as protocol verification tools for topology lifespan maximization and effective data transfer processing. However, those previously developed simulators have limited functions, such as an event function for a specific sensor or a battery consumption rate test for sensor deployment. Moreover, since the previous load-balancing algorithms consider only the general traffic distribution and the number of connected nodes without considering the current topology condition, the sustainable load-balancing technique that takes into account the battery consumption rate of the dispersed sensor nodes is required. Therefore, this paper proposes the Sustainable Load-balancing Scheme (SLS), which maximizes the overall topology lifespan through effective and sustainable load-balancing of data transfer among the sensors. SLS is capable of maintaining an effective topology as it considers both the battery consumption rate of the sensors and the data transfer delay. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Cloud computing; Convergence processing; Green communication; Sustainable load-balancing","algorithm; communication network; conceptual framework; convergence; information technology; sensor; topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970956406

Soil polluted with heavy metals and chemicals makes significantly negative effects on human and wildlife health. This paper attempts to measure the economic benefits from the contaminated soil remediation policy using a specific case study of Korea. To this end, the contingent valuation (CV) method is employed. A CV national survey of randomly selected 500 households was implemented using person-to-person interviewing in May 2105. To elicit the willingness to pay (WTP), we apply one-and-one-half bound dichotomous choice question format to reduce the potential for response bias and spike model to deal with zero willingness to pay (WTP). The mean WTP for the policy is estimated to be KRW 1,357 (USD 1.2) for next ten years per household per year and statistically significant at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 25.4 billion (USD 22.9 million) per year.

The application of sub-terahertz, especially in spectroscopy, is introduced along with emerging high-performance CMOS technology for sub-terahertz circuits. Basic operation principles and design considerations are discussed for the implementation of a push-push and quadruple-push oscillator. A 410-GHz push-push oscillator is demonstrated using in a 45-nm logic CMOS process.The second harmonic in the cross-coupled oscillator is combined at the push-push node, while the differential fundamental signals are canceled. A quasi-optical technique with high sensitivity and wide bandwidth is devised using an on-chip antenna and FTIR system to evaluate the performance of the oscillator. A 410-GHz push-push signal with the power level of -49. dBm (12.6. nW) is observed. A 553-GHz quadruple-push oscillator is also demonstrated in the same technology. A passive network constructively combines the fourth harmonic currents in the coupling transistors of the quadrature oscillator while other lower harmonics are canceled. Quasi-optical measurements showed that the circuit generates four harmonic signals at 553. GHz with a power level of 220. nW, while suppressing unwanted harmonic signals. The circuit consumes 64. mW from a 1.4-V supply. Those circuits would be readily integrated with various analog and digital circuits to implement practical and affordable sub-THz systems for security, healthcare, industrial, defense, and communication applications. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Due to these intriguing features, the fabrication of an anisotropic surface has been extensively studied as a broad research area. Herein, we present a novel strategy to fabricate asymmetric ratchet-like polymeric structures with various tilting angles by using photo-polymerization and controlling light refraction. We used a prism array that allows directional light transmission through the refraction on one face of it. To construct symmetric ratchets by negating the refraction effect in a specific area, we filled the region of the array with a refractive index matching liquid. To make a ratchet structure with a higher tilting angle, we used two films of the designed prism arrays to refract twice. Furthermore, we demonstrate one step fabrication of ratchet structures with tilting angles of 0°, 24.4° and 49.7° through the combination of the refractive index matching method and double-refraction on two layers of prism arrays. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Fabrication; Photopolymerization; Prisms; Refraction; Refractive index; Anisotropic surfaces; Micro/nanostructures; Multifunctional properties; Novel strategies; Polymeric structures; Refraction effects; Refractive index matching; Water transport; Light transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966335521

Collaborative governance consisting of citizens is crucial for successful SWM. Collaborative governance definitely requires an active participatory decision-making process that reflects citizens' preferences. Citizen preference also tends to substantially change with life pattern and life quality. These shifts can be caused by slight variations in both social priorities and personal preferences for SWM. Therefore, collaborative water governance must be frequently renewed in response to citizens' values through the participatory framework. The An'yang Stream in South Korea is generally regarded as a representative urban stream restoration case that has been successfully led by collaborative governance. By conducting individual surveys with citizens on-site, this study addresses how citizens' preferences of the stream's management have changed between 2005 and 2015. In addition, this study used three quantitative hydrologic vulnerability indices: potential flood damage (PFD), potential streamflow depletion (PSD), and potential water quality deterioration (PWQD). They can spatially quantify citizen preference using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which can systematically derive citizens' subjective relative-weighted preferences. In the end, this study identified critical differences in priorities in regard to vulnerable areas between in 2005 and in 2015. © 2016 by the authors.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Collaborative governance; Hydrological vulnerability; Potential flood damage (PFD); Potential streamflow (PSD); Potential water quality deterioration (PWQD); Sustainable watershed planning","analytical hierarchy process; decision making; flood damage; governance approach; participatory approach; streamflow; temporal variation; vulnerability; water management; water planning; water quality; watershed; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965122970

Depending on the cooling rate affecting the primary and eutectic microstructure, the storage elastic modulus measured by DMA (dynamic mechanical analysis) increased with decreasing DAS, with a concomitant increase in the tensile strength and elongation at RT and also high tempertures. Contrarily, the thermal expansion coefficient increased with increasing temperature, but did not vary with microstructural changes. The hardness of the eutectic phase increased with increasing DAS due to the enlarged size of the eutectic particles, whereas the hardness of the primary phase was similar regardless of DAS, owing to the precipitates that formed during heat treatment. The increase of both of LCF (low cycle fatigue) and HCF (high cycle fatigue) lives with decreasing DAS was observed, mainly due to homogeneous deformation owing to the fine size of eutectic silicon and Fe intermetallic particles. The results of fractography observation showed that finer α-Al and eutectic phases were effective to the resistance of fatigue crack initiation and propagation due to the shorter crack path along the secondary particles. The LCF lives increased with increasing test temperature according to the Coffin-Manson relation due to the larger elongation. On the other hand, an analysis of the fatigue lives with the hysteresis loop energy, which consists of both strength and elongation, showed that the fatigue lives were normalized with an alloy of the same strengthening mechanisms regardless of the test temperature. DMA analysis demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the Al2Cu precipitate hardened alloy were maintained at temperatures greater than 250°C, whereas degradation in the mechanical properties of the Mg-containing alloy occurred at 170°C due to coarsening in the precipitation phase of Mg2Si. © 2016 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.","A319; Automobile; Cylinder head; Dendrite arm spacing; DMA; High cycle fatigue; Low cycle fatigue","Aluminum; Automobiles; Copper alloys; Cracks; Cylinder heads; Cylinders (shapes); Dynamic mechanical analysis; Elongation; Eutectics; Fatigue of materials; Fracture mechanics; Hardness; Mechanical properties; Mechanisms; Microstructural evolution; Microstructure; Precipitates; Tensile strength; Thermal expansion; A319; Dendrite arm spacing; Fatigue crack initiation; High cycle fatigue; High temperature mechanical properties; Low cycle fatigues; Microstructural features; Thermal expansion coefficients; Precipitation (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964940602

The thickness ratio between the NiO-GDC and Ni layer on the cell performance was investigated. The TF-SOFCs with sputtered 210 nm-thick NiO-GDC and 70 nmthick Ni layers exhibited maximum power density of 170 mW/cm2 at 500 °C, which was about two times higher than those without Ni layers (80 mW/cm2). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the performance improvement mostly stems from two factors: The reduced ohmic and anodic activation resistances and the improved anodic kinetics. When the NiO-GDC layer is too thin (70 nm), the ionic conduction in the NiO-GDC layer became sluggish. Therefore, the maximum power density decreased to 132 mW/cm2. Thus, we can conclude a proper thickness ratio between the NiO-GDC and Ni layers is required to maximize cell performance. © 2016 by American Scientific Publishers.","Anode; Nickel; Nickel Oxide-gadolinia-doped ceria; Sputter; Thin film-solid oxide fuel cells",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964733906

Strain gages are used to measure the residual stresses, and electronic speckle-pattern interferometry is used to analyze the response of the welded work to external force. A tensile load is applied to a butt-welded, thin-plate steel specimen, and the resultant strain field is analyzed with the electronic speckle-pattern interferometry. Comparison is made with the case of a nonwelded specimen of the same material and dimension. The analysis indicates that the residual stress due to welding makes the normal strain due to the external tensile load asymmetric. The asymmetry enhances shear and rotational modes of deformation, generating stress concentration at a point away from the weld where the residual stress is substantially negligible.

However, a precise determination of a theoretically well-defined top quark mass is still missing. Towards a precise determination of a theoretically well-defined top quark mass at the LHC, we propose a method which uses lepton energy distribution and has a boost-invariant nature.

More specifically, the authors describes the various characteristics of smart work users and analyzes the effects of antecedents on the intention to use, and the usage behavior of smart work using the first nation-wide survey of smart work in the public sector. The findings reveal that the level of diffusion of smart work appears to be low in terms of number of the users. However, younger workers who have lower positions and shorter job tenures and workers in quasi-governmental organizations show relatively high levels of intention, and actually use smart work more frequently than other employee groups. Structural equation modeling shows that the perceived costs of commuting and business trips, work productivity and efficiency, and institutional and technological support have positive effects on smart work adoption by public employees. In contrast, social isolation and lack of communication, and unfriendly leadership and management associated with smart work have negative effects. Moreover, the intention to use smart work has a mediating effect on the relationships between the drivers/constraints and the usage behavior of smart work. Based on these results, theoretical and policy implications for the promotion of smart work are presented. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Adoption of ICTs in public sector; Smart government; Smart work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961161535

The underlying idea is to combine the advantages of both methods. Acoustoelasticity is capable of evaluating a residual stress absolutely but it is a single point measurement. Optical interferometry is able to measure deformation yielding two-dimensional, full-field data, but it is not suitable for absolute evaluation of residual stresses. By theoretically relating the deformation data to residual stresses, and calibrating it with absolute residual stress evaluated at a reference point, it is possible to measure residual stresses quantitatively, nondestructively and two-dimensionally. The feasibility of the idea has been tested with a butt-jointed dissimilar plate specimen. A steel plate 18.5 mm wide, 50 mm long and 3.37 mm thick is braze-jointed to a cemented carbide plate of the same dimension along the 18.5 mm-side. Acoustoelasticity evaluates the elastic modulus at reference points via acoustic velocity measurement. A tensile load is applied to the specimen at a constant pulling rate in a stress range substantially lower than the yield stress. Optical interferometry measures the resulting acceleration field. Based on the theory of harmonic oscillation, the acceleration field is correlated to compressive and tensile residual stresses qualitatively. The acoustic and optical results show reasonable agreement in the compressive and tensile residual stresses, indicating the feasibility of the idea. © 2016 by the authors.","Acoustoelasticity; Electronic speckle-pattern interferometry; Residual stress analysis; Scanning acoustic microscopy","Acoustic wave velocity; Acoustic wave velocity measurement; Carbides; Computerized tomography; Deformation; Elasticity; Interferometry; Speckle; Stress analysis; Yield stress; Acceleration fields; Cemented carbides; Electronic speckle pattern interferometry; Harmonic oscillation; Optical interferometry; Scanning Acoustic Microscopy; Single-point measurement; Tensile residual stress; Residual stresses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960078343

To increase the rate of this reaction, molybdenum dioxide nanocrystals interconnected on mesocellular carbon foam (MoO2/MSU-F-C) are suggested as a new catalyst. Initially, the optimal amount of MoO2 embedded on MSU-F-C is determined, whereas its activity, reversibility and charge-discharge behavior are investigated. The specific surface area, crystal structure, surface morphology and component analysis of the composite are also measured using BET, XRD, TEM, TGA, EELS and XPS. As a result, the MoO2/MSU-F-C results in a high peak current, small peak potential difference and high electron transfer rate constant, confirming that the composite is an excellent catalyst for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. In terms of multiple charge-discharge tests, a VRFB single cell, including MoO2/MSU-F-C, induces high voltage and energy efficiencies with high specific capacity and a low capacity loss rate. These results are attributed to the intercalation of MoO2 by metal cations such as VO2+ and VO2+ and the existence of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of MoO2/MSU-F-C. The intercalated MoO2 plays an excellent conductor role in promoting fast ionic and electron transfer and reducing overpotential, whereas the hydrophilic functional groups improve the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction by lowering its activation energy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Activation energy; Catalysts; Crystal structure; Electric batteries; Electron transitions; Energy efficiency; Foams; Hydrophilicity; Molybdenum oxide; Nanocrystals; Rate constants; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Charge-discharge behavior; Component analysis; Electron-transfer rate constants; High specific capacity; High-peak currents; Mesocellular carbon foams; Molybdenum dioxide; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958062937

To calculate the locations of UAVs, the distance between Access Points (APs) and UAVs should be measured accurately given that the location of UAVs is obtained on the basis of the distance between APs and UAVs. In this paper, we propose a method to measure the distance between a single beacon and a single AP in an indoor ubiquitous computing environment. We assume that the beacon is attached to the bottom of a UAV. In the indoor experiment, while transferring a beacon, the distances between the beacon and an AP were measured and tuned. Therefore, the accumulated difference between the real beacon location and the calculated beacon location was reduced by 31.1 %. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.",,"Distributed computer systems; Global positioning system; Location; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wireless sensor networks; Access point (APs); Indoor experiment; Multiple UAVs; Ubiquitous computing environment; Ubiquitous computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958059600

Polymer sheets are usually formed by the thermoforming process, in which a polymer sheet is heated and softened in order to be shaped into desired part. In this work, instead of the thermal energy used in the conventional thermoforming process, the energy of ultrasonic vibration was used to soften a polymer sheet. For this purpose, an ultrasonic horn was designed with a number of convex features to be used in the sheet forming. Finite element modal analyses were performed to ensure the desired vibration characteristics: the horn should resonate at a specific frequency and should vibrate along its longitudinal axis. The ultrasonic horn was fabricated based on the results from modal analysis, and then was applied to the thermoforming of a 1.0-mm thick thermoplastic poly-urethane sheet. Considering that this process required only 1.1 s vibration time and 10 s holding time, the proposed ultrasonic sheet forming process is much superior to the conventional thermoforming process in its cycle time. © 2016 Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Finite element analysis; Polymer sheet; Thermoforming; Ultrasonic horn; Ultrasonic vibration","Finite element method; Modal analysis; Polymers; Thermoforming; Ultrasonic effects; Ultrasonic waves; Design and analysis; Finite element modal analysis; Polymer sheet; Sheet forming process; Specific frequencies; Ultrasonic horn; Ultrasonic vibration; Vibration characteristics; Vibration analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955458080

However, they should be considered variables for higher accuracy when FBG sensors are applied to circumstances with temperature changes. In this paper, CTE and TOC of FBG sensors were precisely investigated from ambient room temperature (293 K) to cryogenic temperature (113 K). For this purpose, a new non-linear relationship between the wavelength shift and temperature change was proposed.

The thrust disturbance as well as the mechanical parameter variation due to the mass change influences directly the tracking control performance of APS. To guarantee robustness in the presence of such uncertainty, a high-gain disturbance observer-based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed from the mechanical dynamics. Since the estimated disturbance effectively cancels out real uncertainties in the system, the resulting system behaves like the closed-loop system consisting of the disturbance-free nominal model and the LQR. Since MATLAB-Simulink does not support a library for a LIM, a Simulink library model has been developed using the LIM dynamics. To verify that the proposed scheme has a robust control nature, the comparative simulations are carried out based on the library. The whole control system is implemented using DSP TMS320F28335 for a LIM driven by a three-phase voltage-fed pulse-width modulation inverter. Through comparative experimental results in the presence of disturbances, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme are verified. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Closed loop control systems; Closed loop systems; Controllers; Dynamics; Electric drives; Induction motors; Linear motors; MATLAB; Pulse width modulation; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Uncertainty analysis; Voltage control; Comparative simulation; Disturbance observer; Linear induction motors; Linear quadratic regulator; Mechanical dynamics; Mechanical parameters; Pulse width modulation inverters; Three phase voltage; Electric machine theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954287604

Due to the limited amount of training samples compared to data dimensions, properly imposing loose statistical dependency in learning a regression model is crucial for reliable prediction accuracy. The sparse inverse covariance learning of conditional Gaussian random fields has been recently emerging to achieve this goal, shown to exhibit superior performance to non-sparse approaches. However, one of its main drawbacks is the strong assumption of linear Gaussianity in modeling the input-output relationship. For certain application domains, the assumption might be too restricted and less powerful in representation, and consequently, prediction based on the wrong models can result in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we extend the idea of sparse learning to a non-Gaussian model, especially the powerful conditional Gaussian mixture. For this latent-variable model, we propose a novel sparse inverse covariance learning algorithm based on the expectation-maximization lower-bound optimization technique. It is shown that each M-step reduces to solving the regular sparse inverse covariance estimation of linear Gaussian models, in conjunction with estimating sparse logistic regression. We demonstrate the improved prediction performance of the proposed algorithm over exisitng methods on several datasets. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Gaussian random fields; Mixtures of experts; Multiple-output regression; Sparse inverse covariance estimation","Algorithms; Forecasting; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Maximum principle; Optimization; Regression analysis; Expectation - maximizations; Gaussian random fields; Inverse covariance; Latent variable modeling; Mixtures of experts; Multiple outputs; Statistical dependencies; Sub-optimal performance; Gaussian distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953203881

Hence, the Korean government plans to research and develop best management practices (BMPs) for the management of NPSs. The removal efficiency of BMPs varies due to several factors, including rainfall events. These BMPs can be evaluated by numerous methods, and continuous research is being conducted on improving them. In this study, a correlation analysis was conducted to investigate vegetation coverage and retention time as factors affecting the removal efficiency of a vegetative filter strip (VFS), which is a natural nonpoint pollution reduction facility. The results showed that a longer retention time was associated with a higher removal efficiency of a VFS when the vegetation coverage was maintained. Therefore, adequate vegetation coverage and retention time are required to increase the removal efficiency for the VFSs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Nonpoint source pollution; Retention time; Vegetation coverage; Vegetative filter strips; VFS","Correlation methods; Efficiency; Pollution; Vegetation; Non-point source pollution; Retention time; Vegetation coverage; Vegetative filter strips; VFS; Factor analysis; best management practice; buffer zone; correlation; efficiency measurement; environmental planning; government; nonpoint source pollution; phytoremediation; pollutant removal; pollution control; retention; vegetation cover; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950322559

Such category includes chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand. However, these are not likely to represent benchmark criteria meeting the conditions required by ASM. In this study, experimenting piggery wastewater and an anaerobic digester supernatant from municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) with the use of the microbial respirometric method, the true categories for organic matters were implemented and assessed for the requirements of ASM. It was found that piggery wastewater was categorized with biodegradable organic matters with high content of slowly biodegradable COD, while anaerobic digester supernatant was mostly composed of non-biodegradable organic matters in high content of inert COD. When the COD fraction ratio discovered in this study is applied to an ASM for an accurate monitoring of a treating process of piggery wastewater and anaerobic digester supernatant, the findings could make a useful database in designing a biological treatment process and operating it in MWTP. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anaerobic digester supernatant; COD fraction; Oxygen uptake rate; Piggery wastewater; Slowly biodegradable COD; Soluble inert COD","Activated sludge process; Biochemical oxygen demand; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Biological water treatment; Chemical oxygen demand; Organic compounds; Oxygen; Anaerobic digester; COD fractions; Inert COD; Oxygen uptake rates; Piggery wastewater; Slowly biodegradable COD; Wastewater treatment; activated sludge; anoxic conditions; biodegradation; chemical oxygen demand; digestibility; microbial activity; organic matter; pig; waste facility; wastewater; water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950317833

The explanatory variables are price of labor, price of material, capital cost, and production level. The results indicate that economies of scale are present and statistically significant. Thus, expansion of its DH business would allow KDHC to obtain substantial economies of scale. According to our forecasts vis-à-vis scale economies, the KDHC will enjoy cost efficiency for some time yet. To ensure a socially efficient supply of DH, it is recommended that the KDHC expand its business proactively.

Together with the formation mechanism, their surface property, morphology, crystal structure, and photovoltaic performance were studied. The results showed that the surface-roughened TiO2 NWs had an enhanced specific surface area because of the rough NW surface compared to the pure TiO2 NWs. As a result, the short-circuit current density (8.94 mA/cm2) of DSSCs fabricated with the surface-roughened TiO2 NWs is higher than that (5.88 mA/cm2) of the pure TiO2 NWs. Therefore, the photoconversion efficiency of the surface-roughened TiO2 NWs exhibited a high value of ~3.63% compared to that of the pure TiO2 NWs. This phenomenon can be explained by the enhancement of short-circuit current density by an increased dye adsorption; this is because of the increased specific surface area induced by the NW shrinkage due to the different thermal decomposition behavior of PVP depending on the different molecular weights of PVP. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Overall, the respondents accepted the contingent market, and on average, the mean WTP for the project was estimated to be approximately KRW 1840 (USD 1.6) per year per household. The results can be used in policy-makers' decision-making regarding the economic feasibility of constructing the marina port. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Contingent valuation; Marina port; Public value; Spike model; Willingness to pay","Decision making; Economic analysis; Economics; Marinas; Contingent valuations; Economic feasibilities; Korean Government; Leisure activities; Port development; Public values; Spike models; Willingness to pay; Resource valuation; contingent valuation; decision making; feasibility study; governance approach; leisure industry; port; project assessment; public attitude; questionnaire survey; willingness to pay; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945157265

The fracture toughness was found to have an approximately linear relationship with the logarithmic nanoindentation strain rate, implying that the fracture toughness decreased in a range of (1.64-0.63) MPa m0.5 with an increase in the strain rate ranging from 0.01 s-1 to 0.33 s-1. This characteristic was similar to the KC values of Cu6Sn5 under shear or tensile tests. It was, however, when measured by nanoindentation tests, found to be less sensitive to the strain rate compared to measurements gained through shear or tensile tests. The results here were discussed and compared to those from other studies. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Fracture toughness; Intermetallic compound (IMC); Nanoindentation tests; Strain rate","Copper compounds; Intermetallics; Joints (structural components); Lead-free solders; Nanoindentation; Soldering; Soldering alloys; Strain; Strain rate; Tensile testing; Tin; Berkovich indenters; Investigate effects; Lead-Free; Linear relationships; Nanoindentation tests; Solder balls; Fracture toughness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943608477

The PLE-catalyzed esterification of capric acid with glycerol in reverse micelles was investigated on the catalytic performance and enzyme kinetics. The most suitable structure of reverse micelles was comprised of isooctane (reaction medium) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT, anionic surfactant) with 0.1 of R-value ([water]/[surfactant]) and 3.0 of G/F-value ([glycerol]/[fatty acid]) for the PLE-catalyzed esterification. In the aspect of regio-selectivity, the PLE mainly produced 1-monocaprin without any other products (di- and/or tricaprins of subsequent reactions). Furthermore, the degree of esterification at equilibrium state (after 4h from the initiation) was 62.7% under the optimum conditions at pH 7.0 and 60°C. Based on Hanes-Woolf plot, the apparent Km and Vmax values were calculated to be 16.44mM and 38.91μM/min/mg protein, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","1-monocaprin; Enzyme kinetics; Esterification; Porcine liver carboxylesterase; Reverse micelles","Amino acids; Anionic surfactants; Catalysis; Enzyme kinetics; Enzymes; Esters; Fatty acids; Glycerol; Kinetics; Micelles; Surface active agents; 1-monocaprin; Carboxylesterases; Catalytic performance; Equilibrium state; Hanes-Woolf plots; Optimum conditions; Reverse micelles; Selective production; Esterification; 1 monocaprin; anionic surfactant; carboxylesterase; decanoic acid; docusate sodium; glycerol; monoacylglycerol; octane; organic solvent; porcine liver carboxylesterase; unclassified drug; water; acylglycerol; carboxylesterase; decanoic acid derivative; micelle; rac-glycerol 1-monodecanoate; solvent; surfactant; Article; biotechnological production; catalytic efficiency; enzyme kinetics; esterification; high performance liquid chromatography; Michaelis Menten kinetics; reaction optimization; reaction time; reverse micelle; animal; biosynthesis; catalysis; enzymology; esterification; isolation and purification; kinetics; liver; metabolism; micelle; pH; pig; temperature; Animals; Carboxylesterase; Catalysis; Decanoic Acids; Esterification; Glycerides; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Liver; Micelles; Solvents; Surface-Active Agents; Swine; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942540322

We propose a new forecasting method using linearization of the hazard rate formula of the Bass model. In the proposal, reduced non-linear least square method is used to determine the market potential estimate, after the estimates for the coefficient of innovation and the coefficient of imitation are obtained by using ordinary least square method with the new linearization of the Bass model. Validations of 29 real data sets and 36 simulation data sets show that the proposed method is accurate and stable. Considering the user requirements, our method could be suitable for mid-term forecasting based on the Bass model. It has high forecasting accuracy and superior stability, is easy to understand, and can be programmed using software such as MS Excel and Matlab. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

To investigate the optimum conditions for the hybrid ITO nanoinks, we used four different weight ratios of ITO nanoparticles to ITO sols in the hybrid nanoinks: 0 (sample A), 0.06 (sample B), 0.12 (sample C), and 0.24 (sample D). Sample D exhibited superior sheet resistance (~131.3 Ω/□), good transmittance (~87.2%), and excellent figure of merit (~19.3×10−4 Ω−1) when compared to the other samples. This improvement performance is due to the improved densification of the solution-based ITO films, where the optimum amount of ITO sols in the films served as a smooth medium that linked the high-crystalline ITO nanoparticles. Therefore, our study can offer a novel strategy that can be applied to flexible transparent conducting films (TCFs) as well as to the low-cost fabrication of high-performance TCFs in various optoelectronic applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","A.
