In this study, three different types of BC (RBC: rice husk, WBC: wood chip, MBC: mixture) were modified following five different methods: acidic, alkaline, oxidic, and manganese oxide (MnOx) and iron oxide (FeOx) impregnation. The changes in the physicochemical and morphological properties of the modified BC were investigated, and the adsorption characteristics of three heavy metals (Cd, Pb, and Zn) under single and mixed conditions were compared and evaluated. The improvements in the BC properties varied for different BC types and modification methods; in particular, alkaline and manganese modification caused substantial the changes in the surface area and functional groups (such as aromatic ring, –OH, and Mn–O groups). The BC prepared by manganese oxide impregnation absorbed a high amount of heavy metals (&gt;9.15 mg/g) even under mixed conditions through cation exchange and surface complexation. The distribution coefficient (Kd) of heavy metals was high in the order of Pb &gt; Cd &gt; Zn; thus, the adsorption of Pb replaced that of Zn in competitive adsorption due to the difference in their affinity to BC. Therefore, the results suggest that BC prepared by manganese oxide impregnation is suitable for removing heavy metals from road runoff, as it maintained high heavy metals adsorption regardless of the BC material, even under competitive conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorbent modification; Biochar; Competitive adsorption; Heavy metal; Properties","adsorption; biochar; comparative study; complexation; heavy metal; ion exchange; iron oxide; manganese oxide; surface area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113833315

When HyA of the desired molecular weight is implanted into the human body for regeneration of damaged tissue, it is degraded by hyaluronidase in associated with an inflammatory response. This study sought to evaluate the effects of HyA molecular weight and concentration on pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in murine macrophages. Methods: The structures and molecular weights of HyAs (LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500) were confirmed by 1 H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively. After treatment of murine macrophages with a low (10 µg/mL) or high (100 µg/mL) concentration of each molecular weight HyA, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and changes in immune response in both LPS-stimulated and untreated macrophages were evaluated by assessing nitric oxide (NO) production, and analyzing expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes including by RT-PCR. Results: Molecular weights of LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500 were 13,241 ± 161, 96,531 ± 1,167, 512,657 ± 8,545, and 1,249,500 ± 37,477 Da, respectively. NO production by LPS-stimulated macrophages was decreased by increasing concentrations and molecular weights of HyA. At a high concentration of 100 µg/mL, HMW-1,500 reduced NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages to about 45 %. Using NanoString technology, we also found that the immune-related genes TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, CCL2, and Arg1 were specifically over-expressed in LPS-stimulated macrophages treated with various molecular weights of HyA. An RT-PCR analysis of gene expression showed that HMW-1,500 decreased expression of classically activated (M1) macrophage genes, such as TNF‐α, IL-6, CCL2, and IL-1β, in LPS-stimulated macrophages, whereas medium molecular-weight HyA (MMW-100 and MMW-500) instead increased expression levels of these genes. HMW-1,500 at a high concentration (100 µg/mL) significantly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Expression of genes associated with anti-inflammatory responses (M2 phenotype), such as TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, and Arg1, were increased by high concentrations of MMW-500 and HMW-1,500 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Conclusions: High molecular-weight HyA (i.e., &gt; 1,250 kDa) inhibits pro-inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages and induces anti-inflammatory responses in a concentration dependent manner. © 2021, The Author(s).","Anti-inflammatory; GPC; Hyaluronic Acid; Macrophages; Pro-inflammatory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113782737

In this study, the locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae was assessed under the exposure to 0.1–20 μM PFOS based on its reported neurobehavioral effect. After the number of zebrafish larvae was optimized for proteomics and metabolomics studies, three kinds of omics (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) were carried out with zebrafish larvae exposed to 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μM PFOS. More importantly, a data-driven integration of multi-omics was performed to elucidate the toxicity mechanism involved in developmental neurotoxicity. In a concentration-dependent manner, exposure to PFOS provoked hyperactivity and hypoactivity under light and dark conditions, respectively. Individual omics revealed that PFOS exposure caused perturbations in the pathways of neurological function, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism. Integrated omics implied that there were decisive pathways for axonal deformation, neuroinflammatory stimulation, and dysregulation of calcium ion signaling, which are more clearly specified for neurotoxicity. Overall, our findings broaden the molecular understanding of the developmental neurotoxicity of PFOS, for which multi-omics and integrated omics analyses are efficient for discovering the significant molecular pathways related to developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish. © 2021 The Authors","Integration; Multi-omics; Neurotoxicity; Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; Zebrafish","Metabolism; Molecular biology; 'omics'; Developmental neurotoxicity; Locomotor behavior; Molecular mechanism; Multi-omic; Neurobehavioural; Neurotoxicity; Perfluorooctanesulphonic acid; Zebrafish; Zebrafish larvae; Integration; concentration (composition); experimental study; molecular analysis; neurology; percid; physiological response; toxicity; Danio rerio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111656846

Two different designs in lens dimension have been fabricated and characterized: VFOL-L with a 40-mm diameter and VFOL-S with 10 mm. VFOL-L exhibits a wide dynamic range of focal length variation from 38.52 to 60.39 mm with a center frequency near ~ 10 MHz, which is proper for practical long-range applications with several-cm depth. In comparison, VFOL-S covers a focal variation range from 6.75 to 11.1 mm with ~ 14 MHz, producing a relatively higher-pressure amplitude, which allows the inception of acoustic cavitation at an impedance-mismatched boundary. The nano-composite membrane of VFOL is actuated from a planar to deeply curved shape by externally injecting liquid into the VFOL, resulting in a focal gain up to 255 and a positive peak pressure of > 30 MPa in the VFOL-L case. The minimum-geometrical f-number as low as 0.963 is achieved at the shortest focal length (38.52 mm) with 6-dB lateral and axial spot dimensions of 304 μm and 2.86 mm, respectively.

The electron transport chain system of mitochondria embodies multiple enzyme supercomplexes including complex I to V which located in the inner membrane. Although the simple enzyme activity of some as-isolated complex has been studied so far, the steady-state kinetic analysis of each complex within the form of mitochondrial supercomplex has not been studied in depth. To this end, kinetic parameters of mitochondrial complex I–IV were determined using steady-kinetic analysis using corresponding substrates of them. Catalytic activity and binding affinity between substrates and enzymes were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis–Menten equation. Acquired kinetic parameters represented distinctive values depending on the complexes that can be interpreted by the characteristics of the enzymes including the distinction of substrates or the ratio of the enzyme itself under the supercomplex form. The indirect kcat of the mitochondrial enzymes were varied from 0.0609 to 0.334 s−1 in order of complex III, II, I, and IV and Km of substrates were also diverse from 5.1 μM to 12.14 mM.

This study aims to enhance the performance of kNN for imbalanced datasets, a topic that has been relatively ignored in kNN research. The proposed kNN algorithm, called normalized class coherence change-based k-nearest neighbor (NCC-NN) algorithm, determines the label of a test sample by computing the normalized class coherence changes at class and sample levels for every possible class and assigning the sample to the class with the maximum value. It considers the tendency that the minority classes usually show the lower-class coherence than the majority class. NCC-kNN also utilizes the adaptive k for the class coherence, which is calculated in a weighted manner to reduce the sensitivity to the selection of k. NCC-kNN was applied to 20 benchmark datasets with varying class imbalance and coherence, and its performance was compared with that of five kNN algorithms, SMOTE and MetaCost with standard kNN as a base classifier.

Oversampling methods, in particular, alleviate class imbalance by increasing the size of the minority class. However, previous studies related to oversampling generally have focused on where to add new samples, how to generate new samples, and how to prevent noise and they rarely have investigated how much sampling is sufficient. In many cases, the oversampling size is set so that the minority class has the same size as the majority class. This setting only considers the size of the classes in sample size determination, and the balanced training set can induce overfitting with the addition of too many minority samples. Moreover, the effectiveness of oversampling can be improved by adding synthetics into the appropriate locations. To address this issue, this study proposes a method to determine the oversampling size less than the sample size needed to obtain a balance between classes, while considering not only the absolute imbalance but also the difficulty of classification in a dataset on the basis of classification complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed sample size in oversampling is evaluated using several boosting algorithms with different oversampling methods for 16 imbalanced datasets. The results show that the proposed sample size achieves better classification performance than the sample size for attaining class balance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive boosting; Class imbalance; Ensemble learning; Oversampling; Sampling size","Learning algorithms; Class imbalance; Cost-sensitive learning; Ensemble learning; Imbalanced data; Over sampling; Resampling; Sample size determination; Sample sizes; Sampling size; Training sets; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108998812

Accordingly, its effect on diabetes has been well-studied. However, it is unclear whether it has an effect on mitochondrial dysfunction associated with diabetes. In this study, the effects of emodin and rhein in C. tora seed ethanolic extract (ER/CSEE) on retinal mitochondrial function were examined in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. HFD-fed mice exhibited decreased mitochondrial function followed by compensatory increase in the expression levels of mitochondrial enzymes. However, ER/CSEE treatment for 12 weeks ameliorated the activity of retinal mitochondrial complexes and reduced the expression level of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, except that of complex II and citrate synthase in citric acid cycle. This suggests that repairing capacity of enzymes in electron transport chain and citric acid cycle of mitochondria are different in response to the metabolic state. Therefore, it concluded that emodin and rhein play a pharmacological role in fat metabolism by influencing activities of enzymes in citric acid cycle linked with beta-oxidation in retina. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cassia tora; Emodin; Mitochondria; Oxidative phosphorylation; Rhein; Type 2 diabetes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104993302

However, the torsion data of AFM probes have not been exploited to elucidate the relationship between the applied mechanical force and resultant current. In this study, the effect of the size of ZnO nanorods on the efficiency of conversion of the applied mechanical force into current was investigated by simultaneously acquiring the conductive AFM and lateral force microscopy signals. The conversion efficiency was calculated based on linear regression analysis of the scatter plot of the data. This method is suitable for determining the conversion efficiencies of all types of freestanding piezoelectric nanomaterials grown under different conditions. A pixel-wise comparison of the current and lateral force images elucidated the mechanism of current generation from dense arrays of ZnO nanorods. The current signals generated from the ZnO nanorods by the AFM probe originated from the piezoelectric and triboelectric effects. The current signals contributed by the triboelectric effect were alleviated by using an AFM probe with a smaller spring constant and reducing the normal force. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"article; atomic force microscopy; human tissue; linear regression analysis; spring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100444678

In this paper, we propose a very thin and optically transparent structure with excellent SE for EMP shielding window application. The proposed structure consists of a saltwater layer held between two glass substrates and two metal mesh layers on the outside of the glass, with a total thickness of less than 1.5 cm. The SE and OT of the structure are above 80 dB and 45%, respectively, which not only meet the requirement of EMP shielding for military purposes but also retain the procedure of good observation. Moreover, the OT of the structure can be significantly improved using only one metal mesh film (MMF) layer, while the SE is still maintained high to satisfy the required SE for home applicants. With the major advantages of low cost, optical transparency, strong SE, and flexible performance, the proposed structure can be considered a good solution for transparent EMP shielding windows. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100108725

Herein, new low-temperature-synthesized amorphous (a)-quantized WO3·H2O films for application in EC energy storage devices are proposed. The WO3·H2O films are fabricated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of a spin-coated WCl6 solution by the water molecules in the surrounding atmosphere followed by annealing at 80 °C. This is an original and unique concept in that the induced quantization of a-WO3 increases the number of electroactive sites, provides abundant oxygen vacancies, and widens the band gap, while the intercalated water molecules stabilize the structure, resulting in efficient charge transfer and stress alleviation during electrochemical reactions. Consequently, the transmittance (53.8% at 633 nm) and specific capacitance (78.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) of the flexible electrodes improves. Additionally, the carrier concentration and mobility increase due to a-WO3 quantization, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity, resulting in the rapid switchability (3.7 s for coloration and 2.9 s for bleaching) and high rate capability of the flexible electrodes. The flexible solid-state devices light a 1.5 V white-light-emitting diode and maintain their good EC energy storage performance (76.1% transmittance modulation and 73.1% specific capacitance) even after 300 bending cycles at a bending radius of 1.3 cm. Therefore, the proposed a-quantized WO3·H2O films are promising active electrodes for flexible EC energy storage devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Amorphous quantization; Electrochromic energy-storage devices; Flexible electrodes; Low-temperature processing; WO3·H2O","Capacitance; Carrier concentration; Charge transfer; Chlorine compounds; Electrochromism; Electrodes; Energy gap; Energy storage; Molecules; Solid state devices; Tungsten compounds; Amorphous quantization; Electrochromic energy-storage device; Electrochromics; Energy; Flexible electrodes; Low temperature processing; Quantisation; Specific capacitance; Water molecule; WO3·H2O; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107037892

This research is particularly interested in the so-called power-to-heat (P2H) system, which converts idle power from VRE into heat and utilizes the heat as hot water or heating instead of limiting the power generation from VRE. The research aims to assess the public value by employing contingent valuation (CV) to elicit people's willingness to pay (WTP) for introducing the P2H system in South Korea. To achieve this aim, in June 2020, a CV survey of 1000 interviewees in South Korea was carried out, posing a closed-ended question. Although 53.9% of interviewees did not place any value on the introduction of P2H, the average WTP was found to be KRW 4348 (USD 3.59) per annum, which holds statistical significance. If this sample value is extended to the population, it would be KRW 88.48 billion (USD 73.12 million) per year. The costs incurred in introducing P2H, such as the cost of developing P2H technology, the cost of heat storage infrastructure, subsidies for local district heating operators, and so on, may be compared with the public value.

Recently, FGMs have been manufactured by multi-material additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as material jetting or directed energy deposition, which require high manufacturing costs. This study aims to develop FGMs through vat photo-polymerization AM, specifically the single-vat digital light processing (DLP) process. To differentiate material properties in the single-vat DLP process, two approaches were proposed in the AM and post-curing stages. In the AM stage, we differentiated the brightness of printing images to manipulate the degree of polymerization, so-called graded AM, instead of utilizing the conventional black-and-white images. In the post-curing stage, the additively manufactured parts were selectively cured in accordance with functional requirements. The effects of selective post-curing and graded AM were investigated in terms of the hardness and flexural deformation behavior of the printed specimens. These approaches were then combined to selectively manipulate the degree of polymerization, and thus be used to develop hard yet flexible FGMs. Considering that hardness and flexibility are contradicting properties, the developed FGMs serve as structural metamaterials with high surface hardness and flexural flexibility. The developed hard yet flexible metamaterials can be utilized in the preparation of novel functional structures, without requiring additional coating or assembly processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Digital light processing; Functionally graded material; Metamaterial; Vat photo-polymerization","Additives; Beams and girders; Curing; Functionally graded materials; Hardness; Metamaterials; Photopolymerization; Degrees of polymerizations; Digital light processing; Functional requirement; Functionally graded; Graded materials; Material compositions; Post-curing; Property; Selective polymerizations; Vat photo-polymerization; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113951250

Silicon (Si) pack cementation process of molybdenum borides was performed at 1100 °C for 5 h. Silicide layers including MoSi2 phase were formed on the surface of molybdenum borides by Si pack cementation process. The thickness of silicide layer was about 70.12 μm. Molybdenum borides and pack cemented Molybdenum borides was oxidized at 1000 °C for up to 50 h. Molybdenum borides without pack cementation process was severely oxidized and its weight was reduced by approximately 87% compared to the initial weight due to the evaporation of MoO3 phase. On the other hand, pack cemented molybdenum borides were much less oxidized. In pack cemented molybdenum borides, dense borosilicate layer was formed at the surface, and this layer effectively suppressed continuous oxidation and evaporation of MoO3 phase. Based on these results, we demonstrated that the cause of this difference depends on the coating layer formed on the surface by pack cementation process, and Si pack cementation process is effective in improving the oxidation resistance of molybdenum borides. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Molybdenum boride; Oxidation behavior; Pack cementation process; Surface coating","Cementing (shafts); Coatings; Evaporation; Molybdenum; Molybdenum oxide; Oxidation resistance; Silicides; Silicon; Thermooxidation; Coating layer; High temperature oxidation Behavior; Initial weights; Molybdenum borides; MoO$-3$; MoSi$-2$; Oxidation behaviours; Pack cementation process; Silicide layers; Surface coatings; Borides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111504099

The elaborate calculation of the social costs of air pollution is essential for justifying the substantial public expenditure on air pollution control policies. This study aims to derive the monetary value of reducing different kinds of air pollutants through the public's willingness to pay (WTP). A choice experiment survey is conducted to examine the public perception of air quality improvement, and the collected stated preference data are analysed with the hierarchical Bayesian logit model. The analysis results show that the public valuation of the emission reduction differs for individual pollutants. On average, the monetary value of one ton of emission reduction follows the order of PM2.5, PM10, SOx, TSP, NOx, and VOC. Based on the elicited WTP, the economic feasibility of the two air pollutant reduction plans of the South Korean Government is assessed. The benefit-to-cost ratio of the plans is 0.61 and 0.66, respectively, based on the mean WTP, indicating that they are not economically feasible at the moment. Implications for the efficient budget allocation of air pollution control policies are provided based on the results. © 2021","Air pollution; Atmospheric environment; Cost–benefit analysis; Monetary value; Public perception; Stated preference technique","Air quality; Budget control; Economics; Emission control; Quality control; Air quality improvement; Atmospheric environment; Control policy; Cost-benefits analysis; Government IS; Monetary value; Public perception; Stated preference technique; Stated preferences; Willingness to pay; Cost benefit analysis; air quality; atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; perception; pollution control; willingness to pay; air pollution control; air quality; article; budget; cost benefit analysis; feasibility study; government; human; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; perception; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109198249

Aiming to improve the sinusoidal reference tracking performance as well as to reject lumped sinusoidal disturbances in the control practice, a resonant extended state observer is integrated into the ADRC structure, which guarantees a rigorous stable operation of inverter for bounded filter parameter uncertainties and adverse grid voltage conditions. The grid frequency adaptability is thoroughly considered in the controller design process and synchronization technique, offering an extra capability for GCI to operate under different grid voltage frequency levels or even the frequency deviation caused by grid fault events. Robustness against parameter uncertainty and system stability is analyzed through the discrete-time frequency analysis and pole-zero map approaches.

The electron antineutrinos are detected via the inverse beta decay process using a liquid scintillator detector. A 1MW beam of 3GeV protons incident on a spallation neutron target produces an intense and pulsed neutrino source from pion, muon, and kaon decay at rest. The JSNS2 detector is located 24m away from the neutrino source and began operation from June 2020. The detector contains 17 tonnes of gadolinium (Gd) loaded liquid scintillator (LS) in an acrylic vessel, as a neutrino target. It is surrounded by 31 tonnes of unloaded LS in a stainless steel tank.

Tiron is rate-determining material due to its slow reaction kinetics. To improve that, Tiron is transformed into 2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (TironA), which is effectively formed during the first cycle of QRFB. Once TironA is formed, a desirable two-electron redox reaction with stable and reproducible charge and discharge step of QRFB occurs, although the electron transfer of TironA is still lower than that of AQDS. To further facilitate that of TironA, oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) plasma-treated carbon felt (CF) electrodes are suggested. Oxygen functional groups formed onto CF by O2 plasma become the active sites for redox reaction of TironA. As the amount of oxygen functional groups formed increases, the redox reactivity of TironA is enhanced. In contrast, when N2 plasma is used, pyrrolic N and quaternary N are mainly formed. With the formation, (i) hydrogen atoms within pyrrolic N act as proton donor and interact with oxygen groups of TironA and (ii) nitrogen cations within quaternary N interact with the negatively charged atoms of TironA by electrostatic interaction. Thus, both reaction kinetic of TironA and performance of QRFB increase. Regarding the performance of QRFB using N2 plasma-treated CF, its energy efficiency (EE), discharging capacity, and state of charge are 62%, 17.3 Ahr·L−1 and 64.5% for 50 cycle, which correspond to excellent achievements. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonic acid; anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid; nitrogen plasma treatment; pyrrolic N and quaternary N; quinone-based redox flow batteries","Atoms; Carbon; Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Electron transport properties; Energy efficiency; Felt; Felts; Ketones; Nitrogen; Nitrogen plasma; Oxygen; Quinone; Reaction kinetics; Redox reactions; Acidic conditions; Charge and discharge; Discharging capacity; Electron transfer; Negatively charged; Oxygen functional groups; Redox reactivity; Two-electron redox; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108180491

The effect of chlorination was also investigated in fractionated samples (Aldrich HA, F1–F5) based on molecular weight (MW). Total organic carbon (TOC), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), fulvic-like fluorescence (%FLF), terrestrial humic-like fluorescence (%THLF), weight-average molecular weight (MWw), and carbon structures (13C NMR) were measured for each sample before and after chlorination, and factors relating to the chlorination mechanism were examined using principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the changes in the structural characteristics and the disinfection by-product formation of chlorinated HA and FA differed critically. For chlorinated HA, TOC and %FLF decreased due to oxidation, whereas %THLF was reduced via incorporation; MW also affected the structural changes and THMFP generation.

The specific intermolecular interaction (i.e., Lewis acid-base interaction) between CO2 and organic chemicals with electron donor groups exists, and this phenomenon is supported by many experimental studies using spectrometry and ab initio studies. CO2/alcohol solvent systems under high-pressure conditions are important for supercritical extraction, dehydration of alcohols, and extraction of natural products. Furthermore, the study of the complex between CO2 and alcohols due to the Lewis acid-base interaction is crucial for understanding the solvation process under high-pressure conditions, and for the development of thermodynamic models. In this study, the Lewis acid-base interaction between alcohols and CO2 is treated as a hydrogen bonding interaction, and according to the different association schemes for CO2, the effect on the phase behavior of the CO2/alcohol systems at high pressure was investigated using the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) model. Taking into consideration the self-association of CO2 yields a more satisfactory performance in the high-pressure region than it would without, and increasing association sites of CO2 do not lead to a better performance. In addition, the cross-association energy (i.e., Lewis acid-base interaction energy) parameter is estimated by directly regressing the experimental data over the entire temperature and pressure range, and the calculated results show an improved performance even at much higher pressures. It was found that strong cross-association interactions lead to higher cross-association in both liquid and vapor phases, which contributes to the improved phase behavior at high-pressures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Association; Carbon dioxide; CO2; Hydrogen bonding; Lewis acid-base; PC-SAFT","Association reactions; Complexation; High pressure effects; Hydrogen bonds; Supercritical fluid extraction; Acid-base complex; Alkanols; Carbon atoms; Cross-association; High pressure; High-pressure condition; Lewis acid-base; Lewis acid-base interaction; Performance; Perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theories; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113234910

Because the return data of Bitcoin prices are highly concentrated near zero, small changes of values in the components can cause different results. Based on this characteristic, we propose flattening distribution strategy (FDS) based on the copula theory as a strategy of the manipulating distribution of components artificially to improve the prediction of Bitcoin price return. We consider multilayer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess the performances of FDS.

A visible light-responsive ternary composite of PANI-rGO-MnO2 was synthesized and evaluated its photocatalytic activity of a cationic dye (i.e., methylene blue, MB) in an aqueous solution. The surface morphologies and structural properties of the synthesized PANI, PANI-rGO, and PANI-rGO-MnO2 were examined. In the case of ternary composite, the successful growth/incorporation of MnO2 nanoparticles into the PANI-rGO composite was demonstrated. Furthermore, the lowered optical band gap of the ternary composite illustrates the extended light absorption range for the PANI-rGO-MnO2 photocatalyst. The photocatalytic experiments show that the PANI-rGO-MnO2 ternary composite exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic and photocatalytic activity for 90% degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation within 2 h. It could be attributed to synergistic effects by (i) facilitating the electron transfer from excited by reduced graphene oxide from the excited dye to PANI-MnO2 and (ii) reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron/hole pairs originating from the heterostructure of the ternary composite.

In this work, the compressibility and viscosity of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material is characterized with an instrumented hot end design. Experiments are first performed with a blocked nozzle to characterize the compressibility behavior. The results closely emulate the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) behavior of a characterized generic ABS. Experiments are then performed with an open nozzle over a range of volumetric flow rates and temperatures. The static pressure data is fit to power-law, Ellis, and Cross viscosity models and the dynamic melt pressure data is then used to jointly fit material constitutive models for compressibility and viscosity. The results suggest that the joint fitting substantially improves the fidelity relative to the separately characterized viscosity and compressibility. The implemented methods support material extrusion process simulation and control including real-time identification of process faults such as (1) limited melting capacity of the hot end, (2) skipping (grinding) of the extruder drive gears, (3) low initial nozzle temperature, (4) varying flow rates associated with the intermeshing gear tooth velocity profile, and (5) delays and reduced melt pressures due to drool prior to extrusion. The ability to monitor the printing process for faults in real time, such as that presented in this work, is critical to born qualified parts. Additionally, these approaches can be used to screen new materials and identify optimal processing conditions that avoid these process faults. © 2021","Characterization; Compressibility; Instrumentation; Material extrusion; Viscosity","3D printers; Additives; Butadiene; Compressibility; Digital storage; Extrusion; Nozzles; Printing presses; Styrene; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Characterization; Dimensional accuracy; Faults diagnosis; Instrumentation; Material extrusion; Melt pressures; Process faults; Volumetric flow rate; Weld strength; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109171330

To decrease the frequency in the overfrequency section, the proposed scheme decreases the DFIG active power, thereby absorbing energy into the rotating masses of a DFIG. To increase the frequency in the underfrequency section, the proposed scheme increases the active power, thereby releasing energy from the rotating masses. In the medium and high rotor speed regions, to improve the frequency-regulating capability, the proposed control gain increases as a fourth-order polynomial of the rotor speed. To avoid overdeceleration in the low rotor speed region, the control gain decreases as a sixth-order polynomial of the rotor speed as the rotor speed decreases. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly mitigates the frequency fluctuations under various wind conditions even in high wind penetration levels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Frequency deviation loop; Frequency fluctuations; Frequency-regulating capability; Frequency-responsive power smoothing; Variable control gain","Electric fault currents; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Maximum power point trackers; Speed; Wind; Wind turbines; Active power; Doubly fed induction generators; Frequency deviation loop; Frequency fluctuation; Frequency-regulating capability; Frequency-responsive power smoothing; Normal operations; Power smoothing; Rotor speed; Variable control gain; Asynchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104391206

In addition to the conventional advantages of a small filter inductor, a small clamp capacitor, and low current stress in the primary switches due to the effect of four-phase interleaving, the proposed converter has a low total rms current of switches when operating at a wide-voltage range compared with the existing two- and three-phase converters. Also, the proposed converter was shown to be capable of the complete ZVS turn-on of all switches under a wide duty cycle range of 0.25-0.75 in both power-flow directions when small auxiliary inductors were added. A balanced four-phase transformer structure is proposed not only to cancel the dc-flux offset caused by the dc component of the primary winding current but also to reduce the core volume, footprint, and height of the transformer compared with the separated-core transformer.

In this catalyst, TTF is used as mediator to transfer electron effectively, while GA is crosslinked to gelatin to form non-soluble network. The structure prevents the dissolution of gelatin from aqueous electrolyte and reduces the leaching-out of GOx and TTF molecules. To confirm the crosslinking effect of GA and gelatin, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrochemical evaluations are utilized. According to FT-IR analysis, it was observed that the amide I peak shifted after crosslinking. This is evidence showing the appropriate network formation and the reactivity of CNT/[TTF-GOx]/Gelatin + GA is well preserved even after multiple potential cycling. In addition, its GOx activity is regularly monitored for one month and the measurements prove that the structure prevents the leaching out of GOx molecules. Based on that, EBC using the anodic catalyst shows excellent performances, such as open circuit voltage of 0.75 V and maximum power density of 184 μW/cm2. © 2021 Science Press","Crosslinking of glutaraldehyde and gelatin; Enzymatic biofuel cell; Hemi-acetal bond group; Tetrathiafulvalene","Amides; Biofuels; Carbon nanotubes; Electrolytes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fuel cells; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensors; Molecules; Open circuit voltage; Oxygen; Crosslinking of glutaraldehyde and gelatin; Fourier transform infra reds; Glucose oxidation; Glutaraldehydes; Hemi-acetal bond group; Performance; Protection layers; Tetrathiafulvalenes; Transform infrared spectroscopy; ]+ catalyst; Glucose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103652306

To this end, four attributes of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, abatement in air pollutant emissions, betterment in residential convenience, and enhancement energy security were selected for the impacts. The price attribute was the additional price involved in improving energy efficiency of an apartment per 3.3m2. A total of 1000 interviewees were surveyed across the country through person-to-person interviews. A mixed logit model was applied in estimating a utility function from the gathered CE data to allow for preference heterogeneity. All the coefficient estimates for the utility function showed statistical significance. The marginal WTP estimates for a 1%p reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 1%p abatement in air pollutant emissions, betterment in residential convenience, and enhancement in energy security were KRW 31,740 (USD 28.2), 13,289 (USD 11.8), 64,799 (USD 57.6), and 119,723 (USD 106.4) per 3.3m2, respectively.

Since the as-grown BTO thin films obtained by RF magnetron sputtering at the deposition temperatures of 300–500 °C were amorphous with a low dielectric constant of 20, it is necessary to develop a fabrication process for obtaining crystalline high-k BTO thin films without sacrificing other film properties such as morphology and leakage current. First, it was revealed that ex-situ post-deposition annealing (PDA) at high temperatures in the 700–800 °C range led to the crystallization of BTO films and a high dielectric constant of 121. However, the film morphology deteriorated significantly during PDA, and consequently, a high leakage current was observed due to the rough and discontinuous surface containing voids and micro-cracks. To achieve an excellent leakage current characteristic as well as a high dielectric constant for a crystalline BTO thin film, in-situ crystallization was carried out through local epitaxial growth using a crystalline seed layer. The crystalline BTO seed layer was formed by annealing a 5-nm-thick amorphous BTO film at 700 °C on which the in-situ crystallized BTO main layer was deposited at 500 °C. The in-situ crystallization method resulted in a smooth and uniform surface and a high dielectric constant of 113.

From the test, the representative findings are as follows: (1) A specimen with relatively small size and less lateral reinforcement is more likely to be affected by the wedge action of the anchorage device; however, a larger specimen is affected by both concrete crushing and/or spalling; (2) The behavior of the anchorage zone is markedly affected by the local behavior near the anchorage bearing plate, and the sectional efficiency is mostly determined by A/Ag; (3) For specimens with A/Ag = 9.52, the proportional limit of the load-displacement curve is determined by the yield of spiral rebar or fracture of the bearing plate, but the later part of the curve is determined by lateral confinement; (4) The maximum A/Ag that could produce 100% sectional efficiency is about 2.0 for the anchorage bearing plate used in the test; (5) For a fully confined specimen with a small-diameter spiral for minimum anchorage spacing, the stirrup rebar design mainly influences crack occurrence and patterns when the size of the specimen is equal to the minimum anchorage spacing; however, the area of the load-displacement curve after the proportional limit as well as crack occurrence and patterns are also influenced by stirrup rebar design when A/Ag is relatively large; (6) Finally, a revised design model is proposed to effectively estimate the ultimate bearing strength of the post-tensioning anchorage zone without respect to A/Ag . From the comparison of the design equations, it was concluded that the proposed equation provides a more reliable prediction with a 14.0% average error rate and 5.7% standard deviation of error rate. © 2021 by the authors.

The proposed prototype consists of the two-port MIMO configuration of the mid-band antenna placed at the top and bottom of the substrate, while the 4-port mmWave MIMO antenna is placed sideways. The MIMO configuration at the top and bottom consists of a two-element array to achieve high gain at the mid-band spectrum, while the antennas placed sideways are optimized to cover the 5G-mmWave band spectrum. The overall dimensions of the board were selected the same as the of smartphones, i.e., 151 mm × 72 mm. The mid-band antenna has an operational bandwidth of 2.73 GHz, whereas the mmWave antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 3.85 GHz with a peak gain of 5.29 and 8.57 dBi, respectively. Furthermore, the design is analyzed for the various MIMO performance parameters; it was found that the proposed antennas offer high performance in terms of envelop correlation coefficient (ECC), diversity gain (DG), mean effective gain (MEG) and channel capacity loss (CCL) within operational range.

Several studies have indicated a correlation between POPs and metabolic diseases; however, their effects on mitochondria as a central organelle in cellular metabolism and the usage of mitochondria as functional markers for metabolic disease are barely understood. In this study, a zebrafish model system was exposed to two subclasses of POPs, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), under two different conditions (solitary OCPs or OCPs with PCBs (Aroclor 1254)), and changes in the oxidative stress marker levels and mitochondrial enzyme activities in the electron transport chain of the tail were measured to observe the correlation between POPs and representative biomarkers for metabolic disease. The results indicated different responses upon exposure to OCPs and OCPs with Aroclor 1254, and accelerated toxicity was observed following exposure to mixed POPs (OCPs with Aroclor 1254). Males were more sensitive to changes in the levels of oxidative stress markers induced by POP exposure, whereas females were more susceptible to the toxic effects of POPs on the levels of mitochondrial activity markers. These results demonstrate that the study reflects real environmental conditions, with low-dose and multiple-toxin exposure for a long period, and that POPs alter major mitochondrial enzymes’ functions with an imbalance of redox homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner. © 2021 by the authors.

There were three types of poultry buildings (caged layer house, broiler house, and layer house with manure belt), classified by the mode of manure treatment and ventilation, investigated in this study. Nine sites for each poultry building were selected and visited for measuring the exposure level and emission rate of airborne microorganisms. The total number of airborne bacteria and fungi among the airborne microorganisms were analysed based on the incubation method. Their emission rates were estimated by dividing the emission amount, which was calculated through multiplying indoor concentration (cfu/m3) by ventilation rate (m3/h), into the indoor area(m2) and the number of poultries reared in the poultry building. The mean exposure levels of the total airborne bacteria and fungi in the poultry building were 7.92 (SD:2.66) log (cfu m-3) and 4.92 (SD:1.79) log (cfu m-3), respectively. Emission rates of airborne microorganisms in poultry buildings were estimated to be 0.263 (±0.088) log (cfu hen-1h-1) and 0.839 (±0.371) log (cfu m-2h-1) for total airborne bacteria, and 0.066 (±0.031) log (cfu hen-1h-1) and 0.617 (±0.235) log (cfu m-2h-1) for total airborne fungi. The distribution patterns of the total airborne bacteria and fungi were similar regardless of poultry building type. Among poultry buildings, the broiler house showed the highest exposure level and emission rate of total airborne bacteria and fungi, followed by the layer house with manure belt and the caged layer house (p&lt;0.05). The finding that the broiler house showed the highest exposure level and emission rate of airborne microorganisms could be attributed to sawdust, which can be dispersed into the air by the movement of the poultry when it is utilized as bedding material. Thus, a work environmental management solution for optimally reducing airborne microorganism exposure is necessary for the broiler house. © 2021 by the authors.

Uniform corrosion for MS and pitting corrosion for STS at 298 K were retarded, with inhibition efficiencies of 77% and 86%, respectively. The inhibition of uniform and pitting corrosion was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy in terms of surface roughness and pitting morphologies. The most effective constituent contributing to the inhibitory performance of tea tree extract was revealed to be α-terpineol, with an inhibition efficiency of 83%. The adsorption of tea tree extract was confirmed by surface characterization analysis using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Interestingly, G-and D-peaks of Raman spectra were detected from the inhibited steels, and this finding is the first example in the corrosion inhibition field.

Magnetite (Fe3O4 ) was synthesized at high purity levels—as established via X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 sorption analyses—and tetracycline was degraded within 60 min in the presence of both magnetite and persulfate (K2S2O8 ), while the use of either substance yielded limited degradation efficiency. The effects of magnetite and persulfate dosage, the initial concentration of tetracycline, and the initial pH on the oxidative degradation of tetracycline were interrogated. The results demonstrate that the efficiency of tetracycline removal increased in line with magnetite and persulfate dosage. However, the reaction rate increased only when increasing the magnetite dosage, not the persulfate dosage. This finding indicates that magnetite serves as a catalyst in converting persulfate species into sulfate radicals. Acidic conditions were favorable for tetracycline degradation. Moreover, the effects of using a water matrix were investigated by using wastewater treatment plant effluent. Comparably lower removal efficiencies were obtained in the effluent than in ultrapure water, most likely due to competitive reactions among the organic and inorganic species in the effluent. Increased concentrations of persulfate also enhanced removal efficiency in the effluent. The tetracycline degradation pathway through the magnetite/persulfate system was identified by using a liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer. Overall, this study demonstrates that heterogeneous Fenton reactions when using a mixture of magnetite and persulfate have a high potential to control micropollutants in wastewater. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Heterogeneous fenton reaction; Magnetite; Micropollutants; Sulfate radicals; Tetracycline",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114222592

For the proposed concrete mixture, C24 (24 MPa) was selected and binders for concrete were manufactured using a blend of OPC (ordinary Portland cement), EPC (early Portland cement), and GGBS (ground granulated blast-furnace slag). The results of the experiment confirmed that the combined use of EPC and GGBS greatly improve the early-strength development and chloride resistance of concrete. An analysis revealed that the time for removal of forms can be reduced by 5–9 h from the aspect of early concrete strength. Moreover, in terms of construction productivity, EPC and GGBS were reduced by up to 16.39 h/cycle compared to other concretes. Regarding economic and environmental impacts, EPC and GGBS were more effective than C35 concrete.

Aided by computer technology and machine learning, it is possible to improve the efficiency and robustness of skin disease classification. Deep transfer learning using off-the-shelf deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has huge potential in the automation of skin disease classification tasks. However, complicated architectures seem to be too heavy for the classification of only a few skin disease classes. In this paper, in order to study potential ways to improve the classification accuracy of skin diseases, multiple factors are investigated. First, two different off-the-shelf architectures, namely AlexNet and ResNet50, are evaluated. Then, approaches using either transfer learning or trained from scratch are compared. In order to reduce the complexity of the network, the effects of shortening the depths of deep CNNs are investigated. Furthermore, different data augmentation techniques based on basic image manipulation are compared. Finally, the choice of mini-batch size is studied. Experiments were carried out on the HAM10000 skin disease dataset. The results show that the ResNet50-based model is more accurate than the AlexNet-based model. The transferred knowledge from the ImageNet database helps to improve the accuracy of the model. The reduction in stages of the ResNet50-based model can reduce complexity while maintaining good accuracy. Additionally, the use of different types of data augmentation techniques and the choice of mini-batch size can also affect the classification accuracy of skin diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

A practical issue associated with flow stress at room temperature is discussed in terms of tensile testing of a cylindrical specimen; we deal with both material identification and finite element predictions. The flow model has four major components, namely the stress before, at, and after the necking point and around fracture point. The Swift model has the drawback that not all major points of stress can be covered simultaneously. A term of strain to the third or fourth power (the “second strain hardening exponent”), multiplied and thus controlled by a second strain hardening parameter, can be neglected at small strains. Any effect of the second strain hardening exponent on the identification of the necking point is thus negligible. We use this term to enhance the flexibility and accuracy of our new flow model, which naturally couples flow stress with damage using the same hardening constant as a function of damage. The hardening constant becomes negative when damage exceeds a critical value that causes a drastic drop in flow stress. © 2021 by the authors.

In this process, the oxide and reinforcement phases formed together in the coating layer and, consequently, the hardness and friction characteristics of the titanium surface were improved simultaneously. Specifically, the oxide phases such as SiO2 and TiO2 were formed on the top region of the coating layer through a reaction with oxygen. The reinforcement phases such as TiC and Ti5Si3, a eutectic structure, and martensite occurred in the lower region of the coating below the oxide phases. The reinforcement phases helped increase the hardness of the titanium surface by up to three times. Moreover, due to the influence of the oxide phases, the friction coefficient was reduced by up to 88% after the laser cladding. When the laser scanning speed decreased, the cooling rate decreased; therefore, the crystal size increased, and hardness value decreased. In addition, the friction coefficient decreased as the laser scanning speed decreased due to the increase in the TiO2 content and decrease in the agglomerated SiO2 at low laser scanning speeds. The amount of wear of the specimen reduced considerably after the laser cladding, and only light abrasive wear and fatigue wear were observed on the laser clad surface. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Friction coefficient; Laser cladding; SiC nanopowder; Titanium alloy; Wear resistance","Cladding (coating); Coatings; Eutectics; Friction; Hardness; Laser applications; Laser cladding; Oxide minerals; Scanning; Silica; Silicon; Silicon carbide; Ternary alloys; Titanium; Titanium carbide; Titanium dioxide; Wear of materials; Air environment; Eutectic structures; Friction characteristics; Friction coefficients; Laser scanning speed; Reinforcement phasis; SiC nanoparticles; Titanium surfaces; Reinforcement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111973728

This article estimates additional willingness to pay (WTP) or price premium, for electricity generated from domestic wind power facilities over that from imported ones. For this purpose, a contingent valuation survey of 1000 households was carried out employing the closed-ended question during September 2020. A spike model is utilized to reflect the zero WTP values reported by 58.3% of the interviewees. Several factors affecting the price premium were also analyzed to derive implications. The average price premium for electricity generated from domestic wind power generation facilities was estimated to be KRW 22.5 (USD 0.019) per kWh with statistical significance.

Microstructural analysis showed that the two steels with duplex phases had banded or layered microstructures with relatively fine-grained austenite and coarse-grained delta-ferrite which increased with Al content and decreased with C content. The geometrically necessary dislocation density increased with the fraction of the delta-ferrite phase. The steel with the highest delta-ferrite fraction of 26.6 pct had the highest yield strength of 576 MPa, while that with the delta-ferrite phase of less than 10.0 pct exhibited a mixed deformation behavior comprising deformation twins and dislocation glide which contributed to the highest tensile strength of 802 MPa and total elongation of 43.6 pct owing to an increase in the work hardening rate. In contrast, the Charpy impact test results revealed that the steels with duplex phases of austenite and delta-ferrite exhibited ductile-to-brittle transition behavior, whereas the steel with single-phase austenite had a higher absorbed energy exceeding 100 J at − 196 °C. The delta-ferrite phase had no significant effect on the absorbed energy at room temperature, but it acted as the main site for the propagation of brittle cracks at cryogenic temperatures and thus decreased the low-temperature toughness. © 2021, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Aluminum; Aluminum coated steel; Austenite; Charpy impact testing; Cryogenics; Deformation; Ferrite; Manganese alloys; Strain hardening; Temperature; Tensile strength; Twinning; Cryogenic applications; Cryogenic temperatures; Ductile to brittle transitions; Geometrically necessary dislocation densities; Layered microstructure; Low temperature toughness; Microstructural analysis; Single phase austenite; Manganese steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110599749

However, routine methods for quantification of vivianite bound P (vivianite-P) are needed to establish the link between vivianite formation and operating conditions, as current approaches require specialized instrumentation (Mössbauer or synchrotron). This study modified a conventional sequential P extraction protocol by insertion of an extraction step (0.2% 2,2′-bipyridine + 0.1 M KCl) targeting vivianite-P (Gu et al., Water Research, 2016, 103, 352–361). This protocol was tested on digested and dewatered sludge from two WWTPs, in which vivianite (molar Fe:P ratios of 1.0–1.6) was unambiguously identified by optical microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results showed that vivianite-P was separated from iron(III)-bound P (Fe(III)-P) in the sludge. Vivianite-P constituted about half of the total P (TP) in the sludge from a Fe dosing chemical P removal (CPR) WWTP, but only 16–26% of TP in the sludge from a WWTP using a combination of Fe dosing CPR and enhanced biological P removal (EBPR). The modified protocol revealed that Fe-bound P (Fe-P, i.e., vivianite-P + Fe(III)-P) was the dominant P fraction, in agreement with quantitative 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Moreover, it was shown that the conventional P extraction protocol underestimated the Fe-P content by 6–35%. The established protocol represents a reliable in-house analytical method that can distinguish and quantify vivianite-P and Fe(III)-P in sludge, i.e. facilitate optimized vivianite production at WWTPs. © 2021","Circular economy; Phosphate recovery; Sewage sludge; Solid-state 31P NMR; Vivianite","Chlorine compounds; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Extraction; Iron compounds; Molar ratio; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phosphate minerals; Potassium compounds; Recovery; Scanning electron microscopy; Sewage sludge; Wastewater treatment; Circular economy; Extraction protocols; Fe$+3+$; P removal; Phosphate extraction; Phosphate recovery; Quantitative determinations; SEM-EDS; Solid-state 31P nuclear magnetic resonance; Waste water treatment plants; Nuclear magnetic resonance; ferric ion; phosphate; phosphorus derivative; unclassified drug; vivianite; activated sludge; extraction method; model validation; nuclear magnetic resonance; phosphate; quantitative analysis; scanning electron microscopy; sewage treatment; spectroscopy; vivianite; Article; chemical composition; elemental analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; enhanced biological phosphorus removal; extraction; microscopy; oxidation; particle size; pH; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; quantitative analysis; scanning electron microscopy; sewage; sludge; sludge dewatering; sludge management; solids retention time; temperature; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110146467

However, conventional mechanical milling methods have reached certain limits in further improving the properties of W and its alloys. In this study, with the aim of synthesizing W based composite powder with homogeneously dispersed yttrium oxide (Y2O3) nanoparticles, a novel process methodology combining ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and subsequent hydrogen reduction has been described. Our results reveal that the W-Y2O3 composite powders consisted of multiple primary particles of approximately 30 nm with a three-dimensional network and are of high purity. TEM and XPS analysis results demonstrated that Y2O3 nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed into the tungsten matrix. In comparison with pure W sintered body, the W-Y2O3 composite showed a refined grain structure, higher relative density and Vickers hardness, and the combination of an intergranular and a transgranular fracture mode and these were mainly attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of Y2O3 nanoparticles. Our work shows that ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and subsequent hydrogen reduction is a promising method for preparing high quality ODS-W with high density, fine grains and uniformly dispersed strengthening phase nanoparticles. © 2021","Oxide dispersion strengthening; Spark plasma sintering; Tungsten; Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis; Yttrium oxide","Dispersions; Hydrogen; Mechanical alloying; Nanoparticles; Spray pyrolysis; Synthesis (chemical); Textures; Tungsten; Vickers hardness; Yttrium oxide; Composite powders; Highest temperature; Hydrogen reduction; Mechanical; Oxide dispersion strengthened; Oxide dispersion strengthening; Property; Spark-plasma-sintering; Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis; Y$-2$/O$-3$; Spark plasma sintering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108443234

Despite the excellent electrical property and pattern ability of Cu material, the Cu–Cu bonding process is affected by the high bonding temperature and easy oxidation. Thus, the ability to protect the copper surface in a reactive air environment is very important in Cu–Cu bonding, especially for die–to–wafer Cu bonding applications. We studied Cu–Cu bonding using a copper nitride nanolayer as an antioxidant passivation layer and investigated the stability of the copper nitride nanolayer over 7 days and its decomposition capability across temperatures of up to 400 °C. We found that the copper nitride (Cu4N) nanolayer formed by two-step Ar/N2 plasma treatment protected the copper surface from further oxidation in the air, and that the energy required for thermal decomposition of the copper nitride nanolayer in this study was about 29.6 kJ/mol. It can be seen that the bonding temperature of Cu–Cu bonding can be sufficiently lowered by using a low–temperature decomposition property of copper nitride.

In this study, the CDM tool was utilized to model methane emission reduction. The modeling results showed that methane emission reductions are 683,580 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) for the 10-year period 2021–2030, covering 0.4% of total emission in Myanmar. This study helps local authorities evaluate LFG capture and flaring facilities that could be financially self-sustaining by preventing methane emissions into the environment.

In this study, the characteristics of dissolved and particulate contaminants in tributaries of the Anyang watershed, South Korea, were investigated using various analytical indicators (e.g., organic matter, nutrients, and spectroscopic analysis), heat maps, and multivariate analysis techniques, including cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), to evaluate water quality characteristics of the tributaries and major pollutant sources. The influence of particulate matter from each tributary was also evaluated by investigating changes in sediment composition and re-suspended sediment oxygen demand (RSOD) at the mainstream of Anyang. The heat map patterns of the evaluated tributaries reflect sufficiently the characteristics of the pollutant sources, which enables the differentiation of the pollutant source according to the tributary locations and seasons. PCA results showed that water quality and spectral indicators reflected the different characteristics of the tributary; thus, it enabled a more diverse evaluation of tributary depending on pollutant source and season. The tributary watershed showed a high suspended solids (SS) discharge load depending on the watershed area (r = 0.94, p < 0.05), and the sediment near the tributary with higher SS discharge load revealed a higher content of fine sand (0.002–0.2 mm, r = 0.84, p < 0.05). The finer the particles derived from tributaries are, the higher the increase in RSOD is due to resuspension, most of which are caused by microbial activity (> 80%). Our results demonstrate that comprehensive and visual evaluation—including spectral indicators and heat maps analysis—of the tributary characteristics of pollutant sources is an efficient approach of broadening the knowledge of the distribution and effects of particulate matter from tributaries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Heat map; Pollutant sources; Sediment composition; Sediment oxygen demand; Tributary; Water quality","Biochemical oxygen demand; Cluster analysis; Dissolved oxygen; Multivariant analysis; Particles (particulate matter); Principal component analysis; Quality control; Spectroscopic analysis; Suspended sediments; Water pollution; Watersheds; Heat maps; Map analysis; Particulate Matter; Particulates; Pollutant sources; Principal-component analysis; Sediment composition; Sediment oxygen demand; Suspended solids; Tributary; Water quality; chemical composition; dissolved matter; multivariate analysis; oxygen; particulate matter; pollutant source; tributary; visualization; water quality; watershed; Anyang River; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105341240

In this paper, we proposed a novel planar saltwater as a solution to overcome the difficulty. The electrical and optical characterizations of the planar saltwater are experimentally investigated with good agreement to theoretical prediction. The saltwater has a high average OT of 91.8% which is highest among conventional TEs. Moreover, the planar saltwater shows a shielding effectiveness (SE) above 22 dB with only 3 mm of thickness in the C-band. The SE can be significantly improved by an increase in the thickness of planar saltwater. Along with other advantages of cheap, safe, easy access, and flexible performance, the saltwater can be considered as a potential candidate for transparent electromagnetic shielding applications. © 2021, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","EM shielding; Optical transparency; Saltwater; Transparent electrode","Electromagnetic compatibility; Shielding; Transparent electrodes; C-bands; Electrical performance; Electromagnetic applications; Optical characterization; Optical transparency; Shielding effectiveness; Electromagnetic shielding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104871698

Particularly, an EBS-based seismic reinforcement method (SRM) is proposed, and a damper system is constructed based on this method by considering performance enhancement and cost reduction. In a column reinforcement test, the yield strength and maximum strength of a direct web connection test piece (reinforced only via the direct bonding of the web) were marginally lower than those of a plate and web direct connection (PWC) test piece (reinforced by the direct bonding of the column and steel plate). However, the yield strength and maximum strength of the direct web connection test piece were 2.17–3.09 times those of the unreinforced specimen. In addition, it was verified that the strength decreased by approximately 13–18% compared with that of the PWC test piece. Moreover, a significant strength improvement effect could be achieved even when the web of the H-beam was attached directly to the reinforced column. The plate strength improved moderately because of the installation of the additional plate. In addition, in a reinforced frame test, the yield strengths of the SRM-I (simple reinforcement frame) and SRM-II (shear reinforcement frame with K-type inserts) test pieces were 1.27 and 2.47 times greater than that of the reinforced concrete frame specimen. Further, the maximum strengths of the SRM-I and SRM-II test pieces were 2.22 and 2.95 times greater than that of the reinforced concrete frame specimen. The rate of reduction in stiffness for the reinforced concrete frame specimen was the highest and that for the SRM-II test piece was the lowest. A review of the crack pattern, load–displacement relationship, accumulated energy dissipation, and stiffness reduction rate revealed that the SRM-II specimen displayed the highest seismic performance. © 2021, Iran University of Science and Technology.","Eccentric Brace frame; Resilience-based design; Seismic retrofit; Steel damper","Concrete construction; Concrete testing; Cost reduction; Energy dissipation; Plates (structural components); Reduction; Seismology; Stiffness; Testing; Yield stress; Energy dissipation devices; Performance enhancements; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic Performance; Seismic reinforcements; Seismic retrofitting; Stiffness reduction; Strength improvements; Reinforced concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104130681

The concepts of the work breakdown structure (WBS) and risk breakdown structure (RBS) have been presented to identify hazard hierarchies. With these tools, it is possible to subdivide and find work and risk units easily. Accordingly, this study suggests a novel approach called integrated WBS and RBS (i-WRBS) to identify such hierarchies in the construction industry. The research process involves four steps: (i) collection of data, (ii) classification of data, (iii) development of the i-WRBS, and (iv) conduct of a statistical analysis. Through the research process, i-WRBS is constructed with five levels, combining WBS up to level 4 and RBS at level 5. The i-WRBS approach consists of facility types (nine cases), project types (35 cases), work types (41 cases), and accident types (20 cases) arranged in a hierarchy. This study analyzes 5732 fatal incident cases from 2007 to 2016 in the construction industry in South Korea, with these incidents subdivided according to project, work, and accident types. The proposed i-WRBS method can show different hazard hierarchies depending on the project and work types. While the categories of ‘Industrial facility’ (facility type), ‘Factory’ (project type), ‘Steel Work’ (work type), and ‘Fall’ (accident type) have the largest numbers of fatal incident cases, ‘Explosion’ is the most critical accident type during a ‘Plant installation’ in a ‘Warehouse’ project. In order to identity differences in the proposed types and groups, a chi-square test, Welch's test, and then a post-hoc test (Games-Howell test) were conducted. The proposed i-WRBS method can contribute to identifying significant construction hazards considering the types of projects, work and accidents. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Construction accident; i- WRBS; Risk breakdown structure; Variance test; Work breakdown structure","Construction industry; Hazards; Statistical tests; Accident types; Construction accidents; Construction hazards; Fatal incidents; I- WRBS; Research process; Risk breakdown structures; Variance test; Work breakdown structure; Work type; Accidents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103127661

In the simultaneous mode, by operating the common leg as a lagging leg of the phase-shift full bridge (PSFB) converter, the conduction losses of the common leg switches are decreased due to current cancellation effect, and the lagging leg switches of the PSFB converter achieve entire ZVS operation. Further, in the APM standalone mode, entire ZVS operation of the lagging leg switches is also secured by utilizing the magnetizing current of the LLC resonant converter. As a result, the proposed integrated charger achieves comprehensive improvement in terms of efficiency as well as volume and cost.

In this study, a simple method is proposed to fabricate suspended nanowires at desired locations using an electrospinning process and a designed microstructure. Using electrospun polymer fibers on the designed microstructure as a sacrificial template, various materials are deposited on it, and the electrospun fibers are selectively removed, leaving only nanowires of the deposited material. After the polymer fibers are removed, the remaining metal fibers agglomerate into a single nanowire. Throughout this process, including the removal of the polymer fibers, the samples are not exposed to high temperatures or chemicals, thereby allowing the formation of nanowires without oxidation or contamination.

In the present study, the characteristics, behavior, and effects of PM from an urban watershed under photo-irradiation were investigated through sequential resuspensions before being compared. Changes in the organic matter content, heavy metals (Mn, Fe, Zn, Pb), spectroscopic indices (SUVA254, slope ratio (SR), humidification index (HIX), fluorescence index (FI), and biological index (BIX)), excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis components (EEM-PARAFAC), and disinfection by-product formation potential (DBPFP) were analyzed. According to our results, light enhanced the release of organic matter from PM but reduced dissolved heavy metals. The PMU affected by urban-derived pollutants (i.e., rainfall particles, road-deposited sediment, sewer-pipeline-deposited sediment) exhibited higher quantities of terrestrial humic-like organic matter than PMR, which contains base particles from riverines (i.e., soil, sediments). For the PMU, the humic-like fluorescent components (C1 and C2) enhanced under light conditions with every resuspension, whereas the components decreased in the PMR. Consistent with the PARAFAC results, the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of the PMU was enhanced by approximately 2.8 times more than that of the PMR, and exhibited a high correlation with the fluorescent components (C1, r = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001). The principal component analysis results also confirmed that the characteristics of dynamic exchanges between PM and DM were distinguished by PM sources and light, and the photo-released DM and their spectral characteristics displayed opposite behaviors depending on the PM sources during the sequential resuspensions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic exchange; Particulate matter; Photo-irradiation; Sequential resuspension; Urban watershed","Biogeochemistry; Dissolution; Fluorescence; Heavy metals; Image enhancement; Irradiation; Organic compounds; Particles (particulate matter); Principal component analysis; Sediments; Water quality; Down-stream; Dynamic exchange; Long-term effects; Organics; Particulate Matter; Particulates; Photo-irradiation; Re-suspension; Sequential resuspension; Urban watershed; Watersheds; iron; lead; manganese; zinc; dissolved matter; irradiation; particulate matter; photodegradation; resuspension; sequential extraction; watershed; Article; bleaching; concentration (parameter); light; particle resuspension; particle size; particulate matter; photodegradation; physical chemistry; surface area; urban area; watershed; factor analysis; humic substance; particulate matter; soil; spectrofluorometry; water quality; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humic Substances; Particulate Matter; Soil; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106370425

Unlike the existing GMG methods, the present method does not require the generation of a sequence of coarse grids so that all the problems related to coarse-grid generation can be eliminated. Instead, only the sets of nodes in coarse levels are constructed for multigrid computation from the finest grid by using the node-coarsening algorithm that can be employed for any kind of a 2D/3D unstructured grid as well as a hybrid grid on the finest level. The implementation of the present coarsening algorithm is simple in the sense that the boundary information of the finest grid is not required. A searching algorithm to calculate the area/volume-shape function of the finite element method is also proposed to derive an operator for linear interpolation of multigrid computation. We have successfully validated the proposed method for various 2D/3D benchmark problems by showing that the elapsed time of the present GMG method is linearly proportional to the number of unknowns of a linear system of equations. We have also confirmed that the proposed method is nearly as efficient as the grid-based MG method based on a sequence of coarse grids in terms of CPU time. Lastly, we have successfully validated the meshless GMG method by solving an elliptic equation formulated by the finite volume method on a complicated 3D geometry filled with a hybrid unstructured mesh. © 2021","Finite element method; Linear interpolation; Meshless geometric multigrid method; Node-coarsening algorithm; Unstructured grid","Coarsening; Finite volume method; Geometry; Interpolation; Linear systems; Ostwald ripening; Coarse grid; Coarsenings; Element method; Geometric multigrid methods; Linear Interpolation; Meshless; Meshless geometric multigrid method; Multi-grid; Node-coarsening algorithm; Unstructured grid; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106351581

A total of 450 male and female zebrafish was exposed to mixtures of five OCPs at 0, 0.05, 0.25, 2.5, and 25 μg/L for 12 weeks. T2D-related hematological parameters (i.e., glucose, insulin, free fatty acid, and triglycerides) and mitochondrial complex I to IV activities were assessed. Metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics were analyzed in female livers, and their data-driven integration was performed. High fasting glucose and low insulin levels were observed only at 0.05 μg/L of the OCP mixture in females, indicating a nonlinear and sexually dependent response. We found that exposure to the OCP mixture inhibited the activities of mitochondrial complexes, especially III and IV. Combining individual and integrated omics analysis, T2D-linked metabolic pathways that regulate mitochondrial function, insulin signaling, and energy homeostasis were altered by the OCP mixture, which explains the observed phenotypic hematological effects. We demonstrated the cause-and-effect relationship between exposures to OCP mixture and T2D using zebrafish model.

First, we constructed a target design space considering the required natural frequency of the displacer spring assembly under the geo-metric constraints of total mass and module height. The design of experiments was employed to construct simulation cases for design factors such as the outer diameter, thickness, and number of spirals in the spring sheet. As a result, the optimized design values were obtained to satisfy the design requirements. We also fabricated a test spring specimen and conducted fatigue tests using a linear actuator system developed to have the same motion as the engine.

If a fatality occurs, it is important to estimate the overall loss, as a significant financial loss occurs for each project participant. However, in studies of the cost of accidents involving a fatality conducted abroad, the framework cannot be applied as it is because insurance types, systems, and legal cost systems differ by country. Therefore, we developed a framework for calculating the fatality loss considering various aspects of labor, industry, and regulations in Korea. This was done in four steps: (i) data collection and criteria selection; (ii) proposed framework development; (iii) conduct of questionnaire surveys for the case study; and (iv) analysis and evaluation of the case study. As a result of the data analysis after the case study of general construction companies, the total fatality loss was estimated to be 2,198,260 USD/person.

To enable the selection of materials with proper response against the strain that occur during crack movement, this study proposes and demonstrates a new evaluation method for determining and comparing strain concentration of waterproofing materials under the effect of concrete crack movement. For the proposed testing method and demonstration, three common types of waterproofing material types were selected for testing, poly-urethane coating (PUC), self-adhesive asphalt sheet (SAS) and composite asphalt sheet (CAS). Respective materials are installed with strain gauges and applied onto a specimen with a separated joint that undergoes concrete crack movement simulation. Each specimen types are subject to repeated movement cycles, whereby strain occurring directly above the moving joint is measured and compared with the strain occurring at the localized sections (comparison ratio which is hereafter referred to as strain concentration ratio). Specimens are tested under four separate movement length conditions, 1.5 mm, 3.0 mm, 4.5 mm and 6.0 mm, and the results are compared accordingly. Experimental results show that materials with strain concentration ratio from highest to lowest are as follows: PUC, SAS and CAS. © 2021 by the authors.

Unfortunately, the uncertainties of EVs, in terms of their connection/dis-connection times and their initial SOC values, make integrating EVs into microgrids a more chal-lenging issue. Contrary to the standard energy management system (EMS), integrating EVs into microgrids raises several multi-objective problems that need to be solved. In this study, a centralized power flow control scheme for an EV-connected DC microgrid (DCMG) is proposed to satisfy these multi-objective problems under several constraints. Two prime objective functions of the DCMG are presented to demonstrate the benefits to both the DCMG system and EV owners. Then, a reliable and optimized DCMG system is constructed to satisfy the selected prime objective function. The operating modes of each agent in the DCMG are defined based on information regarding the EV connection/disconnection status, the initial EV SOC values, the generation power of the wind power agent, the battery SOC levels, and the grid availability. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme have been validated by in-depth simulations and experimental tests under the uncertainties of DG power, grid availability, electricity price conditions, and EV connections.

Diabetic macular edema (DME) occurs when DR affects the macula, which causes fluid accumulation in the macula. Efficient screening systems require experts to manually analyze images to recognize diseases. However, due to the challenging nature of the screening method and lack of trained human resources, devising effective screening-oriented treatment is an expensive task. Automated systems are trying to cope with these challenges; however, these methods do not generalize well to multiple diseases and real-world scenarios. To solve the aforementioned issues, we propose a new method comprising two main steps. The first involves dataset preparation and feature extraction and the other relates to improving a custom deep learning based CenterNet model trained for eye disease classification. Initially, we generate annotations for suspected samples to locate the precise region of interest, while the other part of the proposed solution trains the Center Net model over annotated images. Specifically, we use DenseNet-100 as a feature extraction method on which the one-stage detector, CenterNet, is employed to localize and classify the disease lesions. We evaluated our method over challenging datasets, namely, APTOS-2019 and IDRiD, and attained average accuracy of 97.93% and 98.10%, respectively. We also performed cross-dataset validation with benchmark EYEPACS and Diaretdb1 datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods due to more effective localization power of CenterNet, as it can easily recognize small lesions and deal with over-fitted training data. Our proposed framework is proficient in correctly locating and classifying disease lesions. In comparison to existing DR and DME classification approaches, our method can extract representative key points from low-intensity and noisy images and accurately classify them. Hence our approach can play an important role in automated detection and recognition of DR and DME lesions. © 2021 by the authors.","Deep learning; Diabetic macular edema; Diabetic retinopathy; Medical imaging; Retinal images","Automation; Blood vessels; Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Extraction; Eye protection; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Automated detection; Classification approach; Diabetic retinopathy; Feature extraction methods; Quantitative result; Real-world scenario; Region of interest; State-of-the-art methods; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112130428

This study proposed a deep-learning based model to estimate agricultural water withdrawal using hydro-meteorological variables, which projected the changes of agricultural water withdrawal influenced by climate change of future. The relationships between meteorological variables and stream water-use rate (WUR) were quantified using a deep belief network (DBN). The influences of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and monthly averaged WUR on the performance of the developed DBN model were tested. As a result, this DBN with potential evapotranspiration (PET) provided better performances than precipitation to estimate the WUR. The PET of multi-model scenarios for Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 would be increased as time goes by, and thus leads to increase WUR estimated by DBN in three basins, located in South Korea during the future period. On the contrary, water availability expected to decrease compared to the current. Therefore, managing water-uses and improving efficiencies can be prepared for the change in agricultural water-use by climate change in the future. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","agricultural water withdrawal; climate change; deep belief network; potential evapotranspiration; RCP 8.5; water-use rate","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Climate models; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Water supply; Agricultural water use; Deep belief network (DBN); Hydrological management; Improving efficiency; Irrigation water use; Learning Based Models; Meteorological variables; Potential evapotranspiration; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113462118

The ANN model to predict the tensile properties exhibited a higher accuracy than the multi linear regression (MLR) model. According to the average index of the relative importance for the input parameters, the yield strength, yield-to-tensile ratio, and uniform elongation could be effectively improved by increasing the fraction of AF, bainitic microstructures (AF, GB, and BF), and PF, respectively, in terms of the work hardening and dislocation slip behavior depending on their microstructural characteristics such as grain size and dislocation density.

In addition, the possible chemical changes of cement paste samples were studied upon exposure to different conditions, including deionized water, seawater, and simulated pore solution. Based on the test results and analysis, no apparent chemical changes were observed in the cement paste samples, regardless of the exposure conditions. In contrast, the PET powder incorporated into concrete exhibited remarkable changes, which may have occurred during the mixing process. The results also suggested that the maximum replacement ratio of PET powder should be less than 10% of the binder (by mass) to minimize its influence on cement hydration, due to the interaction between water and PET.

Usually, the dynamic constitutive model parameters such as those in the Johnson-Cook (JC) model are determined by fitting stress-strain curves obtained by split Hopkins pressure bar (SHPB) tests at various strain rates and temperatures. However, the determination of model parameters by fitting cannot consider potential three-dimensional heterogeneities of stress propagation because the stress and strain are calculated with the assumption of one-dimensional wave propagation. In this study, to accurately determine plastic constitutive model parameters considering all of the potential heterogeneities of stress propagation, an optimization-based inverse method was proposed. Multiple objectives were defined with multiple experimental data that were obtained by SHPB tests at different conditions. The error was defined using transmitted and reflected bar signals obtained in experiments and finite element analysis with candidate model parameters. JC model parameters were set as design variables and determined to minimize the error. To show the reliability of the proposed method, experimental data were generated numerically by FE analysis with known model parameters. The parameters determined by the proposed method were compared with the known exact values. Model coefficients were also determined by fitting the stress-strain relations to show the superiority of the proposed method. Though the fitting of stress-strain curves can also reasonably determine the model coefficients, it was shown that the model parameters could be determined accurately by the proposed optimization-based inverse method. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The high-resolution satellite cameras are designed with a long focal length and a narrow field of view to increase spatial resolution. Thus, images show relatively narrow swath widths (10-15 km) compared to dozens or hundreds of kilometers in mid-/low-resolution satellite data. Therefore, users often face obstacles to orthorectify and mosaic a bundle of delivered images to create a complete image map. With a single mosaicked image at the sensor level delivered only with radiometric correction, users can process and manage simplified data more efficiently. Thus, we propose sensor-level mosaicking to generate a seamless image product with geometric accuracy to meet mapping requirements. Among adjacent image data with some overlaps, one image is the reference, whereas the others are projected using the sensor model information with shuttle radar topography mission. In the overlapped area, the geometric discrepancy between the data is modeled in spline along the image line based on image matching with outlier removals. The new sensor model information for the mosaicked image is generated by extending that of the reference image. Three strips of KOMPSAT-3 data were tested for the experiment. The data showed that irregular image discrepancies between the adjacent data were observed along the image line. This indicated that the proposed method successfully identified and removed these discrepancies. Additionally, sensor modeling information of the resulted mosaic could be improved by using the averaging effects of input data. © 2021 by the authors.","Discrepancy; KOMPSAT-3A; Matching; Mosaic; RPCs; Sensor modeling; Strip",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111675917

In most deployments, AI-based computing systems adopt the architecture in which the central server processes most of the data. This characteristic makes the system use a high amount of network bandwidth and can cause security issues. In order to overcome these issues, a new AI model called federated learning was presented. Federated learning adopts an architecture in which the clients take care of data training and transmit only the trained result to the central server. As the data training from the client abstracts and reduces the original data, the system operates with reduced network resources and reinforced data security. A system with federated learning supports a variety of client systems. To build an AI system with resource-limited client systems, composing the client system with multiple embedded AI processors is valid. For realizing the system with this architecture, introducing a controller to arbitrate and utilize the AI processors becomes a stringent requirement. In this paper, we propose an embedded AI system for federated learning that can be composed flexibly with the AI core depending on the application. In order to realize the proposed system, we designed a controller for multiple AI cores and implemented it on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The operation of the designed controller was verified through image and speech applications, and the performance was verified through a simulator. © 2021 by the authors.

Infrared (IR) radiation provided the driving force of ice sublimation during freeze drying (FD). Different IRAFD conditions were tested, including the continuous IRAFD-1.6 kW/m2 and IRAFD-1.6 kW/m2 at different weight reductions (20%, 40%, and 60%). Conventional FD had a total drying time of 691 ± 19 min, whereas continuous IRAFD significantly reduced the drying time to 309 ± 32 min. Continuous IRAFD also reduced the amount of consumed electrical energy by 42% compared to that of FD. A long duration of IR radiation produced a soft texture in the snacks. Drying kinetics were analyzed using various models, including the Page model, exponential model, and Henderson and Pabis model. The Page model provided the best fit to the experimental drying curve.

The design parameter to be discussed is the intake valve angle. For this purpose, particle image velocimetry was introduced into the steady flow bench, in which four engine heads with 11, 16, 21 and 26 ° valve angles were evaluated changing valve lift. The experiment was conducted at 1.75 B evaluation position. The effect of valve angles and lift was analyzed by the planar flow characteristics of in-cylinder flow and the turbulence kinetic energy variation along the radial direction. 11, 16, and 21 ° have high turbulence kinetic energy near the cylinder wall with the highest flow velocity, and the turbulence kinetic energy around the swirl center is relatively low, indicating the same qualitative characteristics. 26 ° tends to be differentiated from other valve angles, and spatially very complex and fluctuating flow occurred. Complex turbulence kinetic energy distribution pattern appears at all valve angles, while the average turbulence kinetic energy shows a parabolic form as the valve lift increases because of the influence of the flow entry direction by the valve lift. © 2021, KSAE.","Particle image velocimetry(PIV); SI engine; Steady flow; Turbulence kinetic energy(TKE); Valve angle","Cylinder heads; Flow velocity; Intake valves; Kinetics; Steady flow; Turbulence; Velocity measurement; Cylinder walls; Design parameters; In-cylinder flows; Parabolic form; Particle image velocimetries; Qualitative characteristics; Radial direction; Turbulence kinetic energy; Kinetic energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111364049

However, it is difficult to make the feature lines accurately, especially with a small radius and a large angle, in a typical automotive panel stamping process. A simple stamping process to find the minimum formable radius of the subtle feature line for automotive outer panel manufacturing was employed. This study presented three methods to find the minimum formable radius of the feature line; analytical approach, finite element analysis, and experiments. The three approaches showed similar and consistent results. In the experiment, the minimum formable radius of the subtle feature line was 20 mm, 8 mm, 7 mm, and 4 mm, when the punch angles of 175 °, 170 °, 165 °, and 160 °, respectively.

Due to the risks involved in being exposed to the virus, public health actions such as wearing masks and physical distancing are necessary to reduce its spread. However, using non-validated masks is a serious issue as such masks may provide inadequate protection against airborne bioaerosol transmission, resulting in the spread of the virus. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the filtering performances of the masks against bioaerosols as well as particulate matter (PM). Here, we evaluated the filtering performances of sixteen different masks (four brands each of woven, antidroplet, KF80, and KF94 masks) commercially available in Korea with high market shares. As a simulation of being exposed to bioaerosols and to the yellow dust commonly found in Korea, the filtration efficiency levels of the masks were tested against airborne bacteria-containing droplets and against fine dusts of different ranges of particle sizes. Their filtration efficiency levels against the droplets showed strong positive correlations, specifically Pearson correlation coefficient r values of 0.917, 0.905, and 0.894, with their efficiency levels against PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively.

The major phase of all the as-cast alloys is TiFe phase with the B2 ordered body-centered cubic structure. In addition to the TiFe phase, the TiFeZr and TiFeZrCr alloys have TiFe2 phase with the hexagonal C14 Laves structure and a small amount of Ti2Fe phase with a cubic structure. Based on the EBSD analysis, it is observed that the TiFe2 and Ti2Fe phases exhibit slightly higher kernel average misorientation (KAM) values and smaller grain sizes than the matrix TiFe phase. First hydrogenation (activation) test results of the as-cast alloys indicate that the hydrogenation is easily achieved under 30 bar of hydrogen at room temperature by adding Zr or ZrCr2. This seems to be associated with the presence of the TiFe2 and Ti2Fe phases with higher strain that might act as gateways for hydrogen transport during hydrogenation together with the phase boundaries. The hydrogenation kinetics of the TiFeZr alloy is considerably faster than that of the TiFeZrCr alloy, which might be attributed to the finer grain size of the TiFe2 phase in the TiFeZr alloy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Electron back-scattered diffraction; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Microstructure; TiFe alloy","Chromium alloys; Diffraction; Grain size and shape; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Hydrogenation; Iron alloys; Microstructure; Zircaloy; As cast alloy; Body-centred cubic; Cubic structure; Electron back-scattered diffraction; Electron backscattered diffraction analysis; Microstructural analysis; Microstructural characteristics; Mis-orientation; Small grain size; TiFe alloys; Binary alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110436078

The present study attempted regional climate classification to divide the Borneo region into several homogenous groups based on long-term average climate behavior. Daily gridded rainfall and temperature (Tavg, Tmax, and Tmin) data at 0.25° resolution spanning 56 years (1960–2016) was used. The classification was done using non-hierarchical k-mean and several hierarchical methods, namely, Single, Complete, McQuitty, Average, Centroid, Median, and two algorithms of Ward’s method, wardD, and wardD2. The results showed that k-mean, wardD, and wardD2 were able to classify the climate of Borneo into four zones, namely ‘dry and hot’ (DH), ‘wet and hot’ (WH), ‘wet’ (W), and ‘wet and cold’ (WC) with a considerable difference at the boundaries. Spatial relevancy, stability, and variability of the clusters based on correlation and compromise programming showed that the wardD method was the most likely to yield acceptable results with optimum 4-cluster to partition the area into four principal climate zones. The constructed cluster plot, centroid plot, and probability distribution function (PDF) showed a distinct climatic characteristic between the climate zones in terms of rainfall, temperature, and seasonality. The proposed climate zonation for Borneo can help in better understanding climate regionality and climate-related development planning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air temperature; algorithm; climate change; climate conditions; cluster analysis; rainfall; spatial variation; Borneo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110302691

It is found that the structures of the PTB7-th layers formed by solvents with lower boiling points, as well as the PC70BM over-layers, have a higher degree of crystallinity, consequently improving the performance to a degree resembling that of BHJ cells. In addition, sequentially processed samples show much higher thermal stability than BHJ cells, which constitute a nano-blend of donor and acceptor materials. When compared with BHJ cells, whose power conversion efficiency deteriorates within the initial 5 h of thermal treatment, all sequentially processed devices deposited by solvents with different boiling points show significant thermal stability. This work provides comprehensive insight into the interfacial crystallinity of sequentially processed OSCs in terms of efficiency and stability. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","interfacial crystallinity; organic solar cells; sequential process; thermal stability","Boiling point; Conversion efficiency; Crystallinity; Efficiency; Heterojunctions; Nanostructured materials; Solvents; Stability; Thermodynamic stability; Bulk heterojunction; Complex nanostructures; Degree of crystallinity; Donor/acceptor interface; Effect of solvents; Power conversion efficiencies; Sequential process; Thin-film properties; Organic solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109319529

The acai berry extract (ABE) was prepared using 70% ethanol, and total anthocyanin, polyphenol, and flavonoid contents in ABE were analyzed. To the antioxidant activity of ABE, we measured radical scavenging activity as well as ferric reducing antioxidant power values. Prior to inducing inflammation, Caco-2 cells were co-cultured with RAW 264.7. Inflammation was induced using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in RAW 264.7 cells. The transepithelial electrical resistance value was significantly recovered and the mRNA level of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, JAM-1, and claudin-4, tended to increase compared with that in the LPS group. LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and prostaglandin E2 levels reduced significantly following treatment with the highest ABE concentration. In the highest ABE concentration, the phosphorylation of p65, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase was downregulated compared with the LPS group. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase showed a decreased tendency. These results suggest that acai berry may improve gastrointestinal health. Practical applications: Acai berry is known to have abundant anthocyanin, which has many biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antihypertensive, and anticytotoxic/cytoprotective activities. This study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of acai berry extracts via TEER value, expression of tight junction protein, and production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines in the Caco-2 and RAW 264.7 co-culture model. Therefore, acai berry has the potential to prevent intestinal inflammatory diseases. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","acai berry; co-culture model; Gut inflammation; NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathways; tight junction","Anthocyanins; Antioxidants; Enzymes; Pathology; Phosphorylation; Anti-inflammatory effects; Anti-oxidant activities; Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Ferric reducing antioxidant power; Intestinal inflammation; P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; Radical scavenging activity; Transepithelial electrical resistances; Fruits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109080717

In organic memristors, tunable functionality of materials allows for realizing bio-realistic neuromorphic electronics in the view point of the mechanical and electrical characteristics. However, it is challenging to achieve high-density crossbar arrays of organic memristors due to undesirable sneak currents arising from unselected cells. For inorganic systems, considerable effort has been made to fabricate practical arrays by employing external components to suppress sneak current. By contrast, in organic memristors, it is barely possible to achieve practical systems due to the solvent orthogonality limiting the integration of the devices. Herein, an unprecedented structure of organic memristors with high self-selectivity is developed to realize practical crossbar arrays. In the developed memristor, the self-selective characteristics are achieved by systematically engineering the conductive nanofilament diffusion in the polymer. The maximum size of the memristor arrays is found to be more than 1 Mbits, and the neural networks based on the developed device showed reliable recognition performance similar to ideal software systems. This novel concept of developing the organic memristor with high self-selectivity will open a new platform for realizing next-generation flexible memory and practical neuromorphic systems linked to artificial intelligence. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","conductive nanofilament; crossbar array; flexible memristors; organic memristors; self-selectivity","Nanostructures; Neural networks; External components; Inorganic systems; Mechanical and electrical; Neuromorphic systems; Practical systems; Reliable recognition; Software systems; Solution-processed; Memristors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108842635

Sonication induced a partial depolymerization of the molecular structures of amylopectin and amylose. Sonication treatment induced the appropriate structural changes for retrogradation. Although the relative crystallinity of sonicated starch was lower than that of non-sonicated starch, sonicated starch after retrogradation showed much higher relative crystallinity than non-sonicated starch. Regardless of sonication treatment, temperature-cycled storage resulted in a higher degree of retrogradation than isothermal storage, but the rate of retrogradation was greater in sonicated starch than in non-sonicated starch, as supported by retrogradation enthalpy, the Avrami constant, and relative crystallinity. The highly developed crystalline structure in sonicated starches due to retrogradation was reflected by the large amount of resistant starch. © 2021","Avrami kinetics model; High-amylose corn starch; Resistant starch; Retrogradation; Sonication; Structural properties","Crystallinity; Cyclodextrins; Isotherms; Sonication; Starch; Avramus kinetic model; Corn starch; High amylose; High-amylose corn starch; Property; Relative crystallinity; Resistant starch; Retrogradation; Sonication treatment; Temperature cycling; Structural properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108587632

This study attempts to estimate price premium or additional willingness to pay (WTP) for electricity generated using domestic solar power facilities over that from imported ones. As a method to do so, contingent valuation (CV) is adopted. A nationwide CV survey was conducted on 1,000 people during October 2020. A closed-ended question was used to elicit the WTP responses. Furthermore, a spike model was applied to analyzing the WTP data with many zeros. The price premium was estimated to be KRW 26.0 (USD 0.023) per kWh, with statistical significance, which comes to 24.8% of the price of electricity for 2019 (KRW 105 or USD 0.089 per kWh).

However, the mechanism of this action remains unclear. In this study, healthy subjects with mild intermittent constipation were supplemented with B. coagulans SNZ 1969 (BC) or the placebo for 8 weeks (n = 80). Then, we assessed colonic transit time (CTT), weekly complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) scores, bowel discomfort symptom (BDS) scores, and 16S rRNA fecal microbiome profiles. The association between the critically altered gut microbiome and clinical outcomes was analyzed using redundancy analysis (RDA) and validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. BC supplementation significantly improved CTT (p = 0.031), CSBM at weeks 2 (p = 0.045) and 9 (p = 0.038), and BDS at weeks 3 (p = 0.019) and 6 (p = 0.029) compared with the placebo, while altering the community composition of the gut microbiota.

As a demand for the high-resolution OLEDs is given rise to realize the natural images in the eyewear displays, developing efficient methods for producing solution-processed organic patterns has been vital to achieve the practical S-OLEDs. Despite considerable effort to develop the fine organic patterns, an incomplete understanding of the effect of the surface wetting nature on the precise pattern formation inevitably restricts the resolution of the S-OLEDs. Herein, we present the physical picture of forming solution-processed high-resolution organic patterns using wetting phenomena. For macroscale patterns larger than 50 μm, the surface energy difference between the wetting and dewetting regions are critical for governing the pattern fidelity. In contrast, the microscale patterns with a feature size lower than 10 μm are produced by the subtle interplay between the surface energy difference and wettability following the Cassie state of the substrate. High-resolution line patterns with a width of 5 μm of the S-OLED are fabricated by balancing the surface energy difference and wettability of the substrate. The patterned S-OLED exhibits a high-pattern fidelity and stable electro-optical performance without any detrimental effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","High-resolution pattern; Self-organization; Solution-processed organic light-emitting diode; Surface energy; Wetting property","Balancing; Interfacial energy; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Substrates; Energy; High resolution; High-resolution patterns; Lightemitting diode; Organic light-emitting; Self organizations; Solution-processed; Solution-processed organic light-emitting diode; Surface energy differences; Wetting property; Wetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106366256

The contamination rate and death cases are expeditiously increasing. Simultaneously, people are no longer relying on traditional news channels to enlighten themselves about the epidemic situation. Alternately, smart cities citizens are relying more on Social Network Service (SNS) to follow the latest news and information regarding the outbreak, share their opinions, and express their feelings and symptoms. In this paper, we propose an SNS Big Data Analysis Framework for COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction in Smart Sustainable Healthy City, where Twitter platform is adopted. Over 10000 Tweets were collected during two months, 38% of users aged between 18 and 29, while 26% are between 30 and 49 years old. 56% of them are males and 44% are females. The geospatial location is USA, and the used language is English. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is deployed to filter the tweets. Results demonstrated an outbreak cluster predicted seven days earlier than the confirmed cases with an indicator of 0.989. Analyzing data from SNS platforms enabled predicting future outbreaks several days earlier, and scientifically reduce the infection rate in a smart sustainable healthy city environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big Data Analysis; COVID-19; NLP; Smart Healthy City; SNS","Data handling; Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Smart city; Social networking (online); Tin; Analysis frameworks; Big data analyse; Coronaviruses; COVID-19; Geospatial location; Language processing; Natural languages; Service platforms; Smart healthy city; Social network services; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105866607

For efficient big data analysis, deep learning (DL) supports strong analytic capability; it has been applied at the cloud and edge layers by extensive research to provide accurate data analysis at low latency. However, existing researches failed to address certain challenges, such as centralized control, adversarial attacks, security, and privacy. To this end, we propose DeepBlockIoTNet, a secure DL approach with blockchain for the IoT network wherein the DL operation is carried out among the edge nodes at the edge layer in a decentralized, secure manner.

Optimizing the hydrolysis effect in all a-WO3·H2O films, we adjusted the humidity to 25, 35, and 45% in a humid chamber. Specifically, the a-WO3·H2O film fabricated at 35% exhibited a developed porous morphology and an increased number of VO defects, providing increased electrochemically active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity, respectively, due to the accelerated hydrolysis of WOCl4 and the increased intercalation of water molecules. Such behaviors of the a-WO3·H2O film bring about superior flexible EC energy-storage performances of widened transmittance modulation (60.0% at 633 nm), fast switching speeds (3.4 s for coloration speed and 4.2 s for bleaching speed), a high CE (62.7 cm2/C), good specific capacitance (94.2 F/g at 2 A/g), and rate capability (74.3%). Specifically, the increased transmittance modulation and specific capacitance stem from the increased electrochemical activity caused by the enriched electrochemically active sites.

Exploring client values in a postdisaster situation can assist in assessing contracting services and developing a suitable contractual framework for reconstruction projects. This study focuses on an analysis of client values in postdisaster reconstruction projects. In so doing, it investigates how client values within contractors' services in postdisaster reconstruction projects differ from construction projects in business-as-usual conditions. First, a literature review and then interviews are used to discover the client values within contracting services. Then, using a questionnaire survey with clients, this study examines how the importance of the identified values differs between business-as-usual and postdisaster reconstruction projects. Public clients were the main participants of this study because they have considerable experience with postdisaster reconstruction. Differences in the prioritization of client values between the two situations, prompting the need to identify and prioritize clients' value in postdisaster situations, are highlighted. It was then realized that assessing contracting services in postdisaster reconstruction projects requires a specific approach and concept.

This is because the strategy prevents structural degradation; however, Li storage kinetics remains unsatisfactory, resulting in poor ultrafast cycling performance. Therefore, we fabricated an Nb-doped TiO2 (NTO) functional layer as a conductive passivation layer on the LMO surface by horizontal ultrasonic spray pyrolysis deposition. The NTO functional layer suppressed the volume expansion of LMO and exhibited high electrical and ionic conductivity, which resulted in improved structural stability of LMO (related to cycling stability) and increased electron/ion transfer rate (related to ultrafast cycling performance).

The most advantageous feature of the modeling method employed herein is its high reliability because the system-level performance is predicted based on module-level power generation characteristics. A further benefit that the proposed physics-based model affords is that the effect of electrical array configurations (i.e., the particular manner by which the thermoelectric modules (TEMs) are electrically connected) on the waste heat recovery performance of the TEG can be accurately predicted. For this purpose, a three-zone modeling method, wherein each TEM is modeled into heat sink, heat generation, and heat conduction zones, is proposed. Moreover, user-defined functions are embedded into the numerical model to correlate the temperature fields obtained from the transport of momentum and energy with the Seebeck effect and Joule heating that appear as the thermoelectric output power and heat sink/heat generation near the TEM surface. The accuracy and reliability of the numerical model are validated by the experimental results of temperature and output power using a TEG prototype whose configurations and dimensions are identical to those of the proposed numerical model. Further comparisons between the numerical results obtained using eight different electrical array configurations and the corresponding experimental results ensure the robustness of the modeling method and numerical model formulated in this study.

To evaluate the effect of adopting BMPEG as the cross-linker, a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and iron phthalocyanine (FePc) composite (RGO/FePc) support material was used as the under layer in the preparation of an [RGO/FePc]/[GOx-BMPEG] electrode for the hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction. Its electrochemical behavior was verified by comparison with electrodes prepared with GOx alone ([RGO/FePc]/GOx) and a conventional GOx-GA aggregate ([RGO/FePc]/[GOx-GA]). [RGO/FePc]/[GOx-BMPEG] exhibited higher sensitivity (62.4 μW mM−1 cm−2) and longer operating duration (94.5% for 3h) than [RGO/FePc]/[GOx-GA] (52.3 μW mM−1 cm−2, 67.4% for 3 h), even though the amount of GOx on the [RGO/FePc]/[GOx-BMPEG] electrode was found to be around half that on [RGO/FePc]/[GOx-GA] in physiological condition (pH 7.4, 36.5 °C). The excellent performance of the [RGO/FePc]/[GOx-BMPEG] electrode was attributed to the hydrophilicity of the BMPEG cross-links, which mitigates the hindrance of mass transfer typically caused by hydrophobic cross-linkers such as GA, and the bonding of the thiol groups on GOx to BMPEG, which protects the GOx from inactivation. Thus, GOx-BMPEG is a superior alternative to GOx-GA for use in implantable bioelectronics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","1,8-Bismaleimido-diethyleneglycol; Enzyme aggregate; Glucose sensor; Inactivation; Sulfhydryl-maleimide conjugation","Aggregates; Catalyst activity; Electrochemical electrodes; Enzyme electrodes; Glucose; Glucose oxidase; Graphene; Hydrophilicity; Mass transfer; 1,8-bismaleimido-diethyleneglycol; Cross-linkers; Enzyme aggregate; Glutaraldehydes; Hydrophilics; Inactivation; Maleimides; Reduced graphene oxides; Sulfhydryl; Sulphhydryl-maleimide conjugation; Glucose sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104745722

Based on that, a new catalyst consisting of hemin-encapsulated MOF and CNT is developed (Hemin⊂MIL-88-NH2/CNT). To evaluate its catalytic activity, colorimetric and electrochemical evaluations are conducted. When colorimetric method is used, Hemin⊂MIL-88-NH2/CNT shows good catalytic activity due to proper interaction between water media and amine bond of MOF. In electrochemical evaluations, Hemin⊂MIL-88-NH2/CNT has high sensitivity (0.538 μAμM−1cm−2) and low detection limit (0.06 μM) at 0.5–203 μM (R2 = 0.999). Even in amperometric response tests, when 10 μM H2O2 is injected, Hemin⊂MIL-88-NH2/CNT shows a better response than other heme protein- based catalysts ((Hb, Mb and HRP)/CNT) by 2.06–3.26 times. In terms of stability, its catalytic activity is well preserved even under harsh pH and temperature conditions for a long time (89.5% of the initial value after 15 days). With that, it is confirmed that the Hemin⊂MIL-88-NH2/CNT as the catalyst for use in H2O2 sensors is attractive and better than other heme proteins. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biomimetic structure; Hemin; Hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction; Hydrogen peroxide sensor; Metal organic framework","Biomimetic processes; Carbon nanotubes; Catalyst activity; Colorimetry; Crystalline materials; Organometallics; Oxidation; Porphyrins; Proteins; Biomimetic structures; Electrochemical evaluations; H$-2$/O$-2$; Heme-proteins; Hemin; Hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction; Hydrogen peroxide sensor; Metal-organic-frameworks; Molecular aggregation; ]+ catalyst; Hydrogen peroxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103271882

Exposure to the OCP mixture reduced 2-NBDG staining, representing glucose uptake, and stimulated the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduced 2-NBDG uptake and ROS overproduction were compensated by insulin treatment. The expression of proteins such as IRβ, PI3K, and AKT was downregulated, indicating that ROS overproduction contributed to the inhibition of insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Reduction in mitochondria quantity and decreased expression levels of PGC-1α, PDH, and GLUT4 proteins were observed, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction played a causative role in the disruption of glucose uptake. The inhibition of glucose uptake and ROS overproduction caused by the OCP mixture were also found in zebrafish as an in vivo model.

A layered double hydroxide (LDH) of CoFe bimetal was prepared by co-precipitation of bivalent cobalt and trivalent iron and applied to H2S gas stream treatment. CoFe-LDH was optimally synthesized under 3:1 of Co/Fe molar ratio, pH 10 of a mixing solution of precipitating reagents, and 60 °C of aging temperature, which allowed high breakthrough capacity (0.209 g H2S/g) in H2S removal. XPS and spectral analyses on spent CoFe-LDH proved that the H2S removal proceeded through two reaction processes: formed intermediate HS− from dissociated H2S which finally replaced with the hydroxide on the metal surface; and formed HS− through carbonate counter ion at interlayer. This resulted in the formation of CO2 as a gaseous product with CoFeS2 and CoFeSO4 as solid products after the treatment of H2S.

Due to the lack of large annotated datasets, the deep transfer learning technique is often used to classify histopathology images. A softmax classifier is often used to perform classification tasks. Besides, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is also popularly employed, especially for binary classification problems. Accurately determining the category of the histopathology images is vital for the diagnosis of diseases. In this paper, the conventional softmax classifier and the SVM classifier-based transfer learning approach are evaluated to classify histopathology cancer images in a binary breast cancer dataset and a multiclass lung and colon cancer dataset. In order to achieve better classification accuracy, a methodology that attaches SVM classifier to the fully-connected (FC) layer of the softmax-based transfer learning model is proposed. The proposed architecture involves a first step training the newly added FC layer on the target dataset using the softmax-based model and a second step training the SVM classifier with the newly trained FC layer. Cross-validation is used to ensure no bias for the evaluation of the performance of the models. Experimental results reveal that the conventional SVM classifier-based model is the least accurate on either binary or multiclass cancer datasets. The conventional softmax-based model shows moderate classification accuracy, while the proposed synthetic architecture achieves the best classification accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.","Image classification; Support vector machine; Transfer learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111938635

The microstructure changes during creep and stress relaxation were investigated. As the tensile deformation increased in the material, twinning and dynamic recrystallization occurred, especially after the plastic instability. As a result, AZ31B showed lower resistance to creep and stress relaxation due to dynamic recrystallization. Additionally, time-dependent springback characteristics in the V-and L-bending processes concerning the holding time and different forming conditions were investigated. We analyzed changes of microstructure at each forming temperature and process. The uniaxial tensile creep test was conducted to compare the microstructures in various pre-strain conditions with those at the secondary creep stage. For the bending process, the change of the microstructure after the forming was compared to that with punch holding maintained for 1000 s after forming. Due to recrystallization, with the holding time in the die set of 60 s, the springback angle decreased by nearly 70%. Increased holding time in the die set resulted in a reduced springback angle. © 2021 by the authors.

The proposed design is a patch antenna with a defected ground structure, in which ground plane defects are utilized to reduce resonance and achieve wideband operation. The optimized antenna dimensions are 2.5 mm X 4.5 mm with a substrate thickness of 0.203 mm. A prototype antenna was fabricated and measured to verify the performance, and it was established that the simulated and measured results were in good agreement. The measured bandwidth was approximately 6.4 GHz (26.5-32.9 GHz) with a peak gain of 5.62 dBi and an efficiency in operational bandwidth of 84%.

MFCs and MECs have not been able to penetrate the market as economic feasibility is lost when their performances are boosted by nanomaterials. The nanoparti-cles used to realize or decorate the components (electrodes or the membrane) have expensive pro-cessing, purification, and raw resource costs. In recent decades, many studies have approached the problem of finding green synthesis routes and cheap sources for the most common nanoparticles employed in MFCs and MECs. These nanoparticles are essentially made of carbon, noble metals, and non-noble metals, together with a few other few doping elements. In this review, the most recent findings regarding the sustainable preparation of nanoparticles, in terms of syntheses and sources, are collected, commented, and proposed for applications in MFC and MEC devices. The use of naturally occurring, recycled, and alternative raw materials for nanoparticle synthesis is showcased in detail here. Several examples of how these naturally derived or sustainable nano-particles have been employed in microbial devices are also examined. The results demonstrate that this approach is valuable and could represent a solid alternative to the expensive use of commer-cial nanoparticles. © 2021 by the authors.

We found that FasL interacts specifically with tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF)10B, also known as death receptor (DR)5. Autoantibody-induced arthritis (AIA) was attenuated in FasL (Faslgld/gld)-and soluble FasL (FaslDs/Ds)-deficient mice, but not in Fas (Faslpr/lpr and Fas–/–)-or membrane FasL (FaslDm/Dm)-deficient mice, suggesting sFasL promotes inflammation by binding to a Fas-independent receptor. Affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis using human (h) fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSCs) identified DR5 as one of several proteins that could be the elusive Fas-independent FasL receptor. Subsequent cellular and biochemical analyses revealed that DR5 interacted specifically with recombinant FasL–Fc protein, although the strength of this interaction was approximately 60-fold lower than the affinity between TRAIL and DR5. A microarray assay using joint tissues from mice with arthritis implied that the chemokine CX3CL1 may play an important downstream role of the interaction. The interaction enhanced Cx3cl1 transcription and increased sCX3CL1 production in FLSCs, possibly in an NF-kB-dependent manner. Moreover, the sFasL–DR5 interaction-mediated CX3CL1–CX3CR1 axis initiated and amplified inflammation by enhancing inflammatory cell influx and aggravating inflammation via secondary chemokine production. Blockade of FasL or CX3CR1 attenuated AIA. Therefore, the sFasL–DR5 interaction promotes inflammation and is a potential therapeutic target. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

AA treatment (5–20 µg/mL) dose-dependently suppressed the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level and interleukin (IL)-6 protein expression in interferon (IFN)-γ + TNF-α-treated HaCaT cells. The 2,4-dinitrocholrlbenzene (DNCB)-induced AD animal model was developed by administering two AA concentrations (30 and 75 mg/kg/d: AD + AA-L and AD + AA-H groups, respectively) for 18 days. Interestingly, AA treatment decreased AD skin lesions formation and affected other AD characteristics, such as increased ear thickness, lymph node and spleen size, dermal and epidermal thickness, collagen deposition, and mast cell infiltration in dorsal skin. In addition, in the DNCB-induced AD animal model, AA treatment downregulated the mRNA expression level of AD-related cytokines, such as Th1-(TNF-α and IL-1β and-12) and Th2 (IL-4,-5,-6,-13, and-31)-related cytokines as well as that of cyclooxygenase-2 and CXCL9. Moreover, in the AA treatment group, the protein level of inflammatory cytokines, including COX-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, as well as the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, were decreased. Overall, our study confirmed that AA administration inhibited AD skin lesion formation via enhancing immunomodulation and inhibiting inflammation. Thus, AA can be used as palliative medication for regulating AD symptoms. © 2021 by the authors.

However, knowledge and practices that enable quantifying oxidative stress are still lacking. Here, we performed a proof-of-concept study to predict the oxidative stress status in a healthy population using retrospective cohort data from Boramae medical center in Korea (n = 1328). To obtain binary performance measures, we selected healthy controls versus oxidative disease cases based on the “health space” statistical methodology. We then developed a machine learning algorithm for discrimination of oxidative stress status using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)/elastic net regression with 10-fold cross-validation. A proposed fine-tune model included 16 features out of the full spectrum of diverse and complex data.

However, the system performance is not well characterized due to the irregular removal of suspended solid (SS) in the pretreatment (sedimentation) chamber and, hence, its irregular input to the media layer. In this regard, the performance of the granular media layer of an upflow filtration system is investigated herein by the use of various models. Due to the significant variation in the SS concentration of the influent and effluent to and from the media layer, the deep bed filtration model, the k-C* model, and the porous media capture model provide limited descriptions of the system performance. By contrast, the performance is well described using the kinetic model, the modified k-C* model using a specific deposit, and the modified porous media capture model using a specific deposit. The parameters of the latter models are shown to be in good correlation with the filtration velocity, SS removal, and specific deposit. The results suggest that modeling using a specific SS deposit can provide an accurate description of the granular media layer performance under a highly variable influent SS concentration. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the intrinsically unstable nature of the organic compounds involved is delaying their commercialization. Therefore, it is essential to improve the lifetime of OSCs significantly. Here, we investigated the effect of the hydrophobic cyclized transparent optical polymer (CYTOP) as a solution-processable encapsulation layer based on shelf lifetime measurement, current–voltage characteristics, and impedance spectroscopy. We found that CYTOP utilization greatly enhanced OSCs’ shelf lifetime, maintaining 96% of initial performance when unencapsulated devices decreased to 82%. Furthermore, based on the dark current characteristics, ideality factor (n), and Cole–Cole plots, the CYTOP encapsulation is revealed to effectively inhibit unfavorable changes of parasitic resistive components and trap-assisted recombination. These findings provide an inclusive perspective on the shelf lifetime issue and commercialization of the OSCs. © 2021 by the authors.

Because the Hyperloop is different from conventional transportation, various considerations are required in the vehicle-design stage. Particularly, pre-investigation of the vehicle dynamic characteristics is essential because of the close relationship among the vehicle design parameters, such as size, weight, and suspensions. Accordingly, a 1/10 scale Hyperloop vehicle system model, enabling the analysis of dynamic motions in the vertical and lateral directions, was developed. The reduced-scale model is composed of bogies operated by Stewart platforms, secondary suspension units, and a car body. To realize the bogie motion, an operation algorithm reflecting the external disturbance, SC-EDS levitation, and interaction between the bogie and car body, was applied to the Stewart platform. Flexible rubber springs were used in the secondary suspension unit to enable dynamic characteristic analysis of the vertical and lateral motion. Results of the verification tests were compared with simulation results to examine the fitness of the developed model. The results showed that the developed reduced-scale model could successfully represent the complete dynamic characteristics, owing to the enhanced precision of the Stewart platform and the secondary suspension allowing biaxial motions. © 2021 by the authors.

Transient stability is mainly affected by the generation amount of the study region, as well as the transmission topology. Several countermeasures can be taken for transient stability, but the usually used control means are generating unit tripping and generation curtailment. In terms of economic operation, one can say that the solution of generating unit tripping is more beneficial. To maintain the transient stability of the east coast region in the Korean power system, applying generation curtailment in the normal state is further needed, because the required tripping amount is too large for the case of only taking generator tripping, and this might cause a critical decrease in system frequency, possibly resulting in operation of the first stage of under frequency relay (UFR). This paper presents the application of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to relieve the generation curtailment, using the characteristic of fast response of BESS. Assuming that BESSs are installed in the candidate location in the study region, the adequate BESS action of absorbing the kinetic energy from those critical generators after disturbances can improve transient stability, and it can decrease the amount of generation curtailment. This paper includes the results of simulation studies to show the effectiveness of the BESS control for the relief of generation curtailment. © 2021 by the authors.

Superstructures in urban areas are designed and constructed with piled rafts, which are more effective than the conventional piled foundation. However, the settlement of a piled raft induced by tunneling mostly focuses on raft settlement. In this study, therefore, raft and pile settlements were obtained through 3D numerical analysis, and the change rate of settlement along the pile length was calculated by linear assumption. Machine learning was utilized to develop prediction models for raft and pile settlement and change rate of settlement along the pile length due to tunneling. In addition, raft settlement in the laboratory model test was used for the verification of the prediction model of raft settlement, derived through machine learning. As a result, the change rate of settlement along the pile length was between 0.64 and −0.71.

Thus, undistorted data on price and demand are required in obtaining the demand function. This article tries to estimate the demand function for RH by applying the price sensitivity measurement (PSM) technique, with some variation, and then use this to obtain information about the price and income elasticities. To this end, in the PSM survey 1000 households were first asked about their consumption of RH and their expenditure on that consumption and then asked about how much they would lower their demand for RH in response to four hypothetical increases in the price for RH (10%, 20%, 50%, and 100%). Thus, five sets of price and consumption of RH were available for each household. The demand function for RH was estimated using a total of 5000 observations. The price and income elasticities were estimated with statistical significance to be about −0.478 and 0.033, respectively. These values can be utilized in decision‐making and/or policy‐making related to RH management. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, to minimize the temperature of the turbine rotor and stator blades, the internal cooling system was developed. The original rib called the squared-rib has been developed as a turbulence generator to enhance heat transfer ability. This technique is to cast ribs in the serpentine passage inside the turbine blades. By this technique, the vortex exists in the rear rib region that causes a low heat transfer zone. In this investigation, a new rib configuration called the truncated-root rib was designed to reduce the squared-rib disadvantage. The configuration of the truncated-root rib forms a small extra-passage into which the coolant passes through and the vortex is comparatively removed. To investigate the heat transfer performance and fluid flow characteristic of the internal cooling turbine blades, a parametric study of the truncated-root rib with the height and shapes of the extra-passage was performed using three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress transport turbulence model. The numerical results showed that all the heat transfer performance of the truncated-root rib configuration is greater than that of the squared-rib. The Nusselt number in the case of the truncated-root rib increases by 8.56% with the Reynolds number of 37 392, and the thermal performance is 39.24% higher than that of the original shape in the case with Reynolds number 53 697. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Cooling; Navier Stokes equations; Reynolds number; Serpentine; Shear flow; Shear stress; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Turbulence models; Vortex flow; Internal cooling; Numerical investigations; Numerical results; Parametric study; Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations; Shear-stress transport; Thermal Performance; Turbulence generators; Heat transfer performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109360643

The former one bestows the accessibility of more redox-active sites, while the latter facilitates the easy entry of foreign atoms. In this report, we rationally synthesized the mesoporous NiO–SiO2 material with hetero-morphologies by a simple wet-chemical method, followed by calcination. The hetero-morphologies include nanospheres, nanoflakes, and nanoparticles collectively increased the surface area. To further increase the redox activity, the cobalt was hydrothermally doped to the NiO–SiO2 material (Co@NiO–SiO2). Consequently, the Co@NiO–SiO2 electrode demonstrated superior electrochemical response with a higher capacity of 41.7 μAh cm−2 compared to the NiO–SiO2 electrode (25 μAh cm−2) in a three-electrode system. Moreover, the Co@NiO–SiO2 electrode was sustained up to 10,000 cycles by retaining 95.5% of its initial capacity. The ability of the Co@NiO–SiO2 material towards practical applicability was also unveiled by fabricating a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC). The HSC delivered a notable energy density (42.3 μWh cm−2) and power density (10.2 mW cm−2). Furthermore, the HSC exhibited outstanding durability (10,000 cycles) without fading.

An ultrasonic vibration tool actuated by a single actuator, which was designed by asymmetrically installing a single PZT actuator inside a cylindrical tool holder, generated the synchronized two-axis ultrasonic vibration motion on the tool tip along the cutting and thrust directions. By conducting dynamic structural analysis and simulating the tool tip movement trajectory using finite element method, the resonance mode, amplitude, and frequency of the model were optimized to achieve the vibration characteristics required for precision micro-shaping processes. According to the experimental evaluations, the vibration of the tool holder was characterized by a resonance mode of 24 kHz. The cutting performance of the tool was evaluated by comparing the cutting force, machined surface, and chip shape with those using a non-vibration micro-shaping tool. The cutting force was reduced more than 90%, and the machined shape and chip exhaust were improved compared with that in conventional shaping processes. © 2021, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cutting force; Finite element analysis; Micro-shaping; Piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuator; Resonance mode; Ultrasonic vibration cutting","Actuators; Cost effectiveness; Cutting; Cutting tools; Ultrasonic effects; Ultrasonic waves; Cutting performance; Dynamic structural analysis; Experimental evaluation; Machined surface; Movement trajectories; Ultrasonic vibration; Ultrasonic vibration tools; Vibration characteristics; Vibration analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108945922

Additionally, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of pink pepper were measured to determine nutraceutical potential. Pink peppers from Brazil (PPB), India (PPI), and Sri Lanka (PPS) had higher Hunter a* (redness) values and lower L* (lightness) and b* (yellowness) values than black pepper from Vietnam (BPV). Fructose and glucose were detected in PPB, PPI, and PPS, but not in BPV. PPB, PPI, and PPS had greater 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid radical scavenging stabilities and higher total phenolic contents than BPV. BPV had higher levels of piperine than the pink peppers. Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, epicatechin, and p-coumaric acid were detected only in the three pink peppers. PPB significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced reactive oxygen species production with increased Nrf2 translocation from cytosol to nucleus and heme oxygenase-1 expression. PPB and PPS significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced nitrite production and nitric oxide synthase expression by suppressing phosphorylation of p38 without affecting cell viability. Additionally, PPB and PPS significantly suppressed ultraviolet B-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression by affecting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 without cell cytotoxicity. These results suggest that pink pepper is a potential nutraceutical against oxidative and inflammatory stress. © 2021 by the authors.

The formation of mesoporous silica nanomatrix embedded with silver nanoparticles (SiO2:Ag 5 wt% and SiO2:Ag 10 wt%) was confirmed by XRD, FTIR, EDX, BET, and TEM analysis. Also, the obtained results from the above studies revealed that the concentration of silver ions significantly increases the particle size and number of silver nanoparticles formed in the silica matrix. The electrochemical performance was studied using silver-integrated silica nanostructures as a working electrode in KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of SiO2:Ag 5 wt%- and SiO2:Ag 10 wt%-coated electrode was found to be 517 and 580 F/g at current density of 1 A/g. It was also found that SiO2:Ag 10 wt% electrode exhibit an excellent stability with the capacitance retention of 94% than SiO2:Ag 5 wt% (capacitance retention of 85%) after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g. These results may be attributed to the inherent characteristic of more silver nanoparticles present in the silica nanomatrix in SiO2:Ag 10 wt%.

XRD, FTIR, Raman, and EDX studies revealed that phase pure polycrystalline NiFe2O4, MgFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4 having cubic structure were formed when we introduce the desired divalent metal ion during the synthesis. TEM analysis clearly shows that NiFe2O4 and MgFe2O4 samples have spherical shape nanoparticles, while the ZnFe2O4 sample has cube-like nanoparticles with different size distributions. The average size of NiFe2O4, MgFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles was found to be 10 ± 3 nm, 20 ± 2 nm, and 25 ± 4 nm, respectively. We believe that citrate present in Citrus limon fruit extract and nitrate ions that exist in the reaction medium can act as reductant/oxidant leads to auto-combustion and form crystallized MFe2O4 nanoparticles without further high-temperature calcination. From VSM analysis, the saturation magnetization for NiFe2O4, MgFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4 was found as 10.16 emu/g, 8.69 emu/g, and 4.23 emu/g, respectively. The different saturation magnetization of the MFe2O4 nanoparticles has a strong correlation with the magnetic moment of divalent cations (Ni2+, Mg2+, Zn2+), superexchange of Fe3+ ions between the tetrahedral (A) and the octahedral (B) sites as well as owing to particle size/morphology and impurities.

To achieve this aim, in May 2020, a CV survey of 1,000 interviewees in South Korea was carried out employing a closed-ended question. The average household WTP is estimated to be KRW 3,770 (USD 3.07) per annum and secures statistical significance. From a national point of view, using information on the national population, this value comes to KRW 76.72 billion (USD 62.42 million) per year. Although the cost of conserving the species has not yet been accurately estimated, the ECV seems to be larger than the cost of conservation. Thus, it is socially desirable to conserve Cypripedium japonicum, and the conservation should be carried out in a stable and continuous manner. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Contingent valuation; Cypripedium japonicum; Environmental conservation value; Korean lady’s slipper","contingent valuation; endangered species; monocotyledon; Red List; species conservation; willingness to pay; South Korea; Cypripedium; animal; endangered species; human; Orchidaceae; questionnaire; South Korea; Animals; Endangered Species; Humans; Orchidaceae; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107979405

A tripod suction bucket foundation consists of three individual buckets arranged in a triangular shape. The cyclic behaviour and soil-foundation-structure interaction of single suction bucket foundations has been a subject of active research. However, it is difficult to predict the behaviour of tripod bucket foundation because it is structurally complex and requires consideration of cyclic load effects. This study focuses on the behaviour of tripod suction foundations under cyclic loading. The rotational stiffness of the tripod foundation is estimated by combining equations depending on compression, pullout, and rotational stiffness of the single suction bucket with a series of centrifuge model test results. By presenting the theoretical stiffness values, it is verified that the rotational stiffness can be estimated only based on the cross-section of the foundation and the shear modulus of the soil. In addition, it is possible to predict the long-term rotational stiffness of the tripod by applying the vertical stiffness obtained from the cyclic loading test of the single bucket to the simplified method. © 2021","Cyclic behaviour; Rotational Stiffness; Tripod suction bucket foundation; Wind turbine","Cyclic loads; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind turbines; Soil structure interactions; Structural design; Bucket foundation; Cyclic behavior; Foundation design; Load effects; Offshore winds; Rotational stiffness; Soil-foundation-structure interactions; Triangular shapes; Tripod foundations; Tripod suction bucket foundation; Stiffness; alternative energy; cyclic loading; foundation; offshore structure; renewable resource; stiffness; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106357239

Results: The urease covalently immobilized on the magnetic particles and the pH-sensitive liposomes encapsulating ferricyanide were added to the cyclic-voltammeter cell solution where urea was distributed. The conversion of urea into carbonic acid seemed to induce a pH decrease that caused a reduction in the electrostatic repulsion between the headgroups of weakly acidic 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-succinate. The reduction induced the liposomes to release potassium ferricyanide that was encapsulated inside. The effects of urea concentration and pH value were investigated. A specific concentration (0.5 mg/mL) of the urea solution was set to observe the response. The activity of urease was reversible with respect to the pH change between 7 and 5. The sensitivity of this detection was almost identical to the comparable techniques such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a field-effect transistor.

It is used in technologies in the fields of shipbuilding, aerospace, and transportation. In the case of the existing electron beam machining technology, a technology for welding or joining two materials was proposed. In this paper, in order to perform electron beam drilling, a multi-hole is created by increasing the instantaneous vaporization pressure during electron beam machining through a vaporized amplification sheet. A vaporized amplification sheet was prepared for electron beam drilling. The vaporized amplification sheet was made of a 1:3.25 combination of silicone and brass powder. Also, in order to bond the produced vaporized amplification sheet to the SUS 304 stainless steel, a primer was applied on the surface of the metal material to firmly bond the two materials with different properties. If the bonding is weak, the effectiveness decreases due to pressure leakage during electron beam machining. Multi-holes were processed using the fabricated material to fix an acceleration voltage of 120 kV and a current of 12 mA. Also, to compare the multi-hole shape and the processing result, the comparison was performed according to the exposure time of the electron beam. The lower the exposure time, the more fine holes were secured, and as the exposure time increased, the molten pool phenomenon occurred, and processing was not performed in the experimental results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Electron beam drilling; High aspect ratio; Multi-hole machining; Vaporized amplification sheets","Electron beams; Infill drilling; Sheet metal; Silicones; Acceleration voltages; Electron beam machining; Exposure-time; High power density; Industrial fields; Metal materials; Pressure leakages; SUS 304 stainless steel; Electrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105908593

This is the first report on using pyridinium chloride mediated mesoporous MnHAp nanorods synthesis. Pure and Mn doped HAp samples were examined using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies to confirm the prepared HAp nanorods. Furthermore, the fabrication of manganese-doped HAp was successful with the formation of a hexagonal crystal lattice without disturbing the HAp phase. It is because, at the time of synthesis, PO43− ions form an electrostatic interaction with the Mn ions. Furthermore, Mn-doped HAp samples showed a reduction in their sizes of 15, 10–15, 5–10 nm width, and 80–100, 10–15, 20–30 nm length with varied pore diameters and surface area. The pure HAp, MnHAp-1, MnHAp-2, and MnHAp-3 nanorods disclose the surface area of 39.4, 18.0, 49.2, and 80.4 m2 g−1, with a pore volume of 0.0102, 0.0047, 0.0143, and 0.0447 cm3 g−1, the corresponding pore diameter was estimated to be 6, 7, 6, and 4 nm, respectively. Moreover, antibacterial activity reveals effective bactericidal action against infections causing pathogens whereas cytotoxicity examination (MTT assay), and zebrafish results reveal their non-toxic behavior. Therefore, it is evident from the study, that rapid fabrication of mesoporous and diverse structured MnHAp nanorods could be convenient with pyridinium chloride enabled microwave-assisted method as a bactericidal biomaterial for implant applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bactericidal action; Bio-apatite; Bio-waste; MTT assay; Pyridinium chloride; Seashells","Apatite; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydroxyapatite; Manganese; Mesoporous materials; Nanorods; X ray powder diffraction; Bactericidal action; Bio-apatite; Biowastes; Hydroxyapatite nanorods; Mesoporous; Mesoporous hydroxyapatites; MTT assays; Pyridinia chloride; Pyridinium; Seashell; Chlorine compounds; chloride; hydroxyapatite; nanotube; animal; animal shell; microwave radiation; X ray diffraction; zebra fish; Animal Shells; Animals; Chlorides; Durapatite; Microwaves; Nanotubes; X-Ray Diffraction; Zebrafish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105536089

To this end, we present an efficient strengthening method for the ME process by introducing bidirectional in situ infrared (IR) heating during the polymer melt deposition in the 3D-printing process. The auxiliary IR irradiation was applied to heat as-printed polymers in the deposited area along the printing paths at their glass transition temperature, which expectedly led to molecular diffusion and chain re-entanglement at the deposited interface. Consequently, the heating technique not only helped eliminate the structural defects due to the thermal stress but also helped enhance the mechanical strength, particularly of structures layered in transverse and upright directions. The reinforcement effects were confirmed by conducting tensile tests and thermal imaging analysis on typical polymers such as polylactic acid and polycarbonate. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed heating technique in extending the applicability of a wide range of engineering plastics or composite materials for the ME printing method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Anisotropy; In situ heating; Mechanical properties","3D printers; Additives; Glass ceramics; Glass transition; Heating; Infrared imaging; Reinforcement; Tensile testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Auxiliary heating; Extrusion process; Heating process; In-situ heating; Mechanical; Mechanical reinforcement; Property; Anisotropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105329944

The principal advantage of MAXIM is an intuitive graphical user interface drastically improving the accessibility of the software to who are not familiar with computer programming. Here, we present the basic formulation and computation methods that are incorporated in MAXIM. The computation performance is also evaluated for several didactic examples of dielectric metasurfaces which are the main application of MAXIM. The comparison of the calculation results with commercial software based on a finite-difference time-domain method confirms that the computation results of two programs coincide closely with each other within 1% difference. Considering the easy accessibility, wide availability and high reliability, MAXIM will serve the development of related research fields of metasurfaces and nanophotonics. Program summary: Program Title: MAXIM CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/352jpd593h.1 Licensing provisions: LGPL Programming language: Python 3.8 Supplementary material: User guide and tutorial movie Nature of problem: Time-harmonic electromagnetic wave simulations on multilayered periodic structures composed of isotropic materials. Diffraction occurs as a propagating electromagnetic wave meets periodically-structured arrays of materials that have different refractive indices. Wave parameters such as amplitude and phase of diffracted waves are modulated depending on the structure configuration. The main purpose of this software is to calculate complex transmission and reflection coefficients of diffracted waves from dielectric metasurfaces that are composed of arrays of subwavelength antennas. Solution method: Rigorous coupled-wave analysis associated with an extended scattering matrix method. According to Bloch's theorem, diffracted waves from periodic structures can be represented as a truncated Fourier series in which the primitive reciprocal vector is the same as that of periodic structures. Appropriate boundary conditions at the interface of a single structure layer enable development of an eigenvalue equation for which the solution gives a scattering matrix of the layer, and the coupling coefficients within it. In the case of a multilayered structure, a total scattering matrix can be obtained using the Redheffer star product, which interconnects scattering matrices of each layer. Total coupling coefficients can be also calculated using the extended Redheffer star product; this ability is a major advantage of the extended scattering matrix method. Diffraction from periodic structures can be fully described by the total scattering matrix and total coupling coefficients.

However, the exact value of the BKC binding affinity on the contact lens surfaces and its effects on the physical properties of contact lenses have not been studied. Here, the binding affinity of BKC toward two types of contact lenses, those with the wetting agent polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and those without, was calculated. In addition, the refractive power, UV–vis transmittance, contact angle, water content, base curve, and diameter of the contact lenses after treatment with BKC were examined to evaluate the effects of its adsorption on the contact lens. We found that the maximum amount of adsorbed BKC was 2.88 mM for the contact lens without PVP whereas it was 2.32 mM for that with PVP. In contrast, the BKC binding affinities were similar. Crucially, the physical properties of the contact lens changed significantly because of the adsorption of BKC. Although BKC is a widely used preservative, our results suggest that use of PVP-containing contact lenses reduces BKC adsorption and discomfort. © 2021 The Authors","Absorption; Benzalkonium chloride; Contact lens; Physical property; Polyvinylpyrrolidone","Absorption; Adsorbents; Adsorption; Binding energy; Dyes; Physical properties; Wetting; Benzalkonium chloride; Binding affinities; Cationics; Chloride binding; Eye drops; Lens surface; Polyvinyl pyrrolidone; Property; Refractive power; Simple++; Chlorine compounds; benzalkonium chloride; cationic surfactant; eye drops; povidone; water; benzalkonium; preservative; adsorption; Article; binding affinity; contact angle; controlled study; optics; priority journal; refraction index; surface property; ultraviolet radiation; water content; contact lens; hydrophilic contact lens; Adsorption; Benzalkonium Compounds; Contact Lenses; Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic; Ophthalmic Solutions; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104083236

Although the preparation of wollastonite in a solid-state is distinguished as a simple and cheap method with large-scale production, it requires high temperatures (=1400 °C) and consumes quite a long time. The wet methods are considered the best when it comes to preparing the wollastonite nanopowders. However, it has some drawbacks such as its extravagant raw materials and its shorting in preparation which inhibits successful coverage for large-scale production. Herein facile, one-pot modified co-precipitation approach with an easy procedure, shorter reaction time, and in-expensive precursor sodium meta-silicate-pentahydrate and CaCO3 has been utilized for large-scale production of wollastonite nano-powders (76–150 nm). The precipitated product was calcined at different temperatures (800, 900, 1000, and 1100 °C). The phase composition and microstructure of the calcined powders were investigated. They were analyzed by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, and HRTEM. The in-vitro bioactivities of the calcined powders at 1000 &amp;1100 °C were investigated by analyzing their abilities to form apatite on their surface after 21 days in SBF. The apatite mineralization of the powder surfaces was examined through FESEM, EDX, and Raman spectra. The results show that a single-phase wollastonite got formed at all calcined temperatures with a unique silkworm texture. SBF in-vitro test states the formation of HA on the powder surface. Therefore, these powders are expected to be valuable and promising for biomedical applications such as coating and bio cement. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Co-precipitation; SBF in-vitro test; Wollastonite nanopowder; XRD","Apatite; Bioactivity; Biocompatibility; Calcination; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Coprecipitation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Medical applications; Powders; Silicate minerals; Textures; X ray diffraction; Biomedical applications; Calcined powder; Co-precipitation; In-vitro evaluation; Large scale productions; Nano powders; Powder surface; SBF in-vitro test; Wollastonite nanopowder; XRD; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103488181

To achieve this, a proportional-integral (PI) control loop depending on the frequency deviation instead of a proportional control loop used in conventional schemes is added to the maximum power point tracking loop. The P control loop in the proposed frequency-smoothing scheme eliminates the alternating component in the frequency deviation, whereas the I control loop eliminates the slowly-varying component.

The obtained ZnO NRs were studied using standard methods such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results revealed a smaller particle size with a high surface area. The scanning electron microscopy and TEM results showed that the obtained particles were having rod-like morphology with size ranging from ~20 to ~200 nm. The results of the antioxidant and photocatalytic studies showed excellent photodegradation and free radical scavenging. The results of the in vitro toxicological study revealed that the obtained particles were nontoxic to organisms. The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assessments concluded that the NR-treated MCF-7 had gone through necrosis and apoptosis. The ZnO NRs revealed excellent antibacterial activity towards various pathogens. It was clear that the green-mediated method could be considered as a better one for the synthesis of ZnO NRs as it imparts excellent anticancer, antibacterial, and photocatalytic properties. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cytotoxicity; genotoxicity; Leea grandifolia; photocatalytic activity; ZnO NRs","Cell death; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Free radicals; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Morphology; Nanorods; Oxide minerals; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Photocatalytic activity; X ray diffraction analysis; Zinc oxide; Anti-bacterial activity; Free radical scavenging; Genotoxicities; High surface area; Leaf extracts; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic property; Rod-like morphology; Scanning electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103067355

While the conventional TO has been applied to obtain the optimal pseudo density in a macroscale domain, microscale TO involving optimization of the strut diameters of a lattice structure has also been studied. In this study, a multiscale TO method was developed by performing the conventional macroscale TO with additional enhancement of microscale lattices. To compare the structural efficiency of the proposed multiscale TO with that of the macroscale and microscale TOs, three optimization methods were applied to a meta-sandwich beam under a three-point bending load condition. Structural FE analyses were then conducted for the three optimized beams, and their deformation behaviors were compared in terms of the structural stiffness and safety. Three optimized beams were then fabricated by the photo-polymerization type AM process using an acrylic photopolymer, and bending experiments were conducted to investigate their deformation behaviors. From the results, the multiscale TO showed the highest structural stiffness and strength owing to the enhancement of microscale lattices. The energy absorption capability was also improved compared to the result of the macroscale TO. These results demonstrate that the multiscale TO is advantageous in the design of efficient lightweight structures with enhanced structural stiffness and safety compared to the conventional macroscale and microscale TO methods. © 2021, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis; Lattice optimization; Lightweight design; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Bending dies; Deformation; Photopolymerization; Stiffness; Topology; Bending experiments; Deformation behavior; Energy absorption capability; Lattice structures; Optimization method; Structural efficiencies; Structural stiffness; Three point bending; Shape optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102782993

To ensure the homogeneous mixing of micro/nanomaterials in a bioink and then bioprinting, currently, multiple preparation steps must be followed before feeding the bioink to the conventional bioprinting extruder head. To overcome these limitations, a real-time one-step process was obtained by developing a semi-automated twin-screw extruder (TSE) head to synchronously perform systematic mixing and 3D bioprinting. In this study, as a proof of concept, the parameter optimizations for semi-automated mixing of bioink components and 3D bioprinting with the TSE head were demonstrated with an ionic gel (alginate), alpha-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) micro/nanoparticles, and osteoblast cells. The TSE-processed bioink samples showed better bioprintability, with better mechanical and biological properties than the conventional ones. The micro/nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the bioink within 60 s of screw mixing them inside the barrel (with the barrel outlet closed). The live cell distribution in the printed constructs was significantly superior to conventional mixing even with continuous feeding and extrusion-based bioink printing. This novel extrusion head ensured the control of uniform micro/nanomaterials and cell distribution throughout the directly mixed printable bioink with minimal cell damage. Further, they delivered increased batch consistency in real time mixing and bioink printing owing to its highly efficient variable screw pitch design. Higher repeatability than the conventional method of bioink component mixing and its subsequent 3D bioprinting was obtained through increased automation, as well as reduced processing time, demonstrating strong potential in tissue engineering applications through the controlled mixing of bioink components and its 3D bioprinting without damaging the cells. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","3D bioprinter; Extrusion printing; Micro/nanomaterial; Nanocomposite bioink; Semi-automated mixing","3D printers; Automation; Cells; Cytology; Extruders; Extrusion; Mixing; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Biological properties; Conventional methods; Homogeneous distribution; Parameter optimization; Tissue engineering applications; Tri-calcium phosphates; Twin screw extruders; Twin screw extrusion; Cell engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101313512

For this purpose, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added onto the reduced graphene oxide and CoPc composite (RGO/CoPc) to create abundant NH2 axial ligand groups, for anchoring the Co core within the CoPc. Owing to the PEI addition, the onset potential of the hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction was shifted by 0.13 V in the negative direction (0.02 V) and the current density was improved by 1.92 times (1.297 mA cm−2), compared to those for RGO/CoPc (0.15 V and 0.676 mA cm−2, respectively), due to the formation of donor–acceptor dyads and the prevention of CoPc from leaching out. The biocatalyst using glucose oxidase (GOx) ([RGO/CoPc]/PEI/GOx) showed a better onset potential and catalytic activity (0.15 V and 318.7 μA cm−2) than comparable structures, as well as significantly improved operational durability and long-term stability. This is also attributed to PEI, which created a favorable microenvironment for the enzyme. The maximum power densities (MPDs) and open-circuit voltages (OCVs) obtained for HPFCs and EBCs using the suggested catalyst were 105.2 ± 1.3 μW cm−2 (0.317 ± 0.003 V) and 25.4 ± 0.9 μW cm−2 (0.283 ± 0.007 V), respectively.

To ensure the CIA (confidentiality, integrity and accessibility) security model of the networks security and high efficiency of performance results in various resource-constrained applications and environments of the IoT platform, DDO-(data-driven operation) based constructions have been introduced as a primitive design that meet the demand of high speed encryption systems. Among of them, the TMN-family ciphers which were proposed by Tuan P.M., Do Thi B., etc., in 2016, are entirely suitable approaches for various communication applications of wireless mobile networks (WMNs) and advanced wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with high flexibility, applicability and mobility shown in two different algorithm selections, TMN64 and TMN128. The two ciphers provide strong security against known cryptanalysis, such as linear attacks and differential attacks. In this study, we demonstrate new probability results on the security of the two TMN construction versions - TMN64 and TMN128, by proposing efficient related-key recovery attacks. The high probability characteristics (DCs) are constructed under the related-key differential properties on a full number of function rounds of TMN64 and TMN128, as 10-rounds and 12-rounds, respectively. Hence, the amplified boomerang attacks can be applied to break these two ciphers with appropriate complexity of data and time consumptions. The work is expected to be extended and improved with the latest BCT technique for better cryptanalytic results in further research.

Transplanting date shift (TDS) has been considered as an adaptation strategy to climate change, however, its impact on water use, water quality, and rice production is still unclear. This study was designed to assess not only TDS but also drainage outlet raising (DOR) as a practical adaptation strategy to climate change. We analyzed the impacts of climate change on water use, water quality, and water productivity in 12 combination scenarios of TDS and DOR using a well-proven APEX-Paddy model according to 10 General Circulation Models (GCMs). We found that the future runoff and total nitrogen (T-N) load appeared differently in each decade, and the future runoff and T-N load increased more than the irrigation water and rice yield over the observed period of time due to the effects of the rainfall amount and rainfall intensity rather than the effects of the increased temperature. The future rice yield declined continuously as the temperature increased due to the rising CO2; however, a significantly amount of irrigation water was saved due to the TDS. According to the DOR implementation, the future runoff, T-N load, and irrigation water requirement were significantly reduced, while the rice yield increased slightly. The RM5 scenario, which includes both the DOR and 40-day delayed TDS, was ranked as the most effective best management practices (BMPs) with the highest water productivity in all of the scenarios. The results of this study indicated that an adequate combination of TDS and DOR taking into account the weather conditions would mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; APEX; BMP; Climate change; Transplanting date","Climate models; Food supply; Irrigation; Productivity; Rain; Runoff; Water quality; Water supply; Adaptation; Adaptation strategies; APEX; Best Management Practise; Drainage outlet; Nitrogen loads; Shift-and; Total nitrogen; Transplanting dates; Water use; Climate change; adaptation; best management practice; climate change; cultivation; food security; paddy farming; strategic approach; transplantation; water use efficiency; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105693506

This article discusses broad topics, including the material properties, device efficiency, shelf lifetime, and impedance properties. We found that GO offers excellent properties, which are identical to those of conventional HELs, while the shelf lifetime shows a significant 6-fold increase. Furthermore, we discuss the significantly reduced space-charge limited region of an aged GO-based OSC compared with a PEDOT:PSS-based device, which is revealed to be a reason for the different shelf lifetime. We believe that the results will accelerate the development of GO as an HEL for OSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

To meet these needs, this paper introduces a dedicated method that divides activation maps of DNNs into several regions according to the activation size and quantizes them to 4-bit by setting scale factors adaptively for each region.

This paper proposes an integrated platform that equips FMC based on 1-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) to YOLOv2, a representative object detector. Furthermore, we propose a technique to improve the compression efficiency of 1-D DWT-SPIHT in order to maximize latency and power savings by reducing memory BW while minimizing the accuracy degradation caused by FMC. In particular, while most of the existing FMC studies have focused on improving the image quality, this study has a distinction in that it has focused on the accuracy of object detectors.

Fault-tolerant research for voltage-fed dual active bridge converters has caught much attention recently. However, few fault-tolerant methods for current-fed dual active bridge (CF-DAB) converter have been developed because it becomes more challenging due to the asymmetrical structure between primary and secondary sides. In this paper, a new fault-tolerant CF-DAB converter with blocking capacitors is proposed. The operation of the converter when an open-circuit fault occurs in different fault scenarios of the CF-DAB converter is comprehensively analyzed. A frozen phase fault-tolerant method with additional blocking capacitors on both sides of the transformer is proposed. The aim of the use of blocking capacitors is to block the DC current component of the filter inductor from passing through the transformer, which could otherwise result in the saturation of the transformer. Also, the DC blocking capacitors help isolate the faulty phase when the frozen-phase fault-tolerant method is applied. © 2021 IEEE.","Blocking capacitor; Current-fed dual active bridge converter; DC-DC converter; Fault-tolerant converter","DC transformers; Electric utilities; Fault tolerance; Asymmetrical structures; Bidirectional current; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Dual active bridge converter; Dual active bridges; Fault tolerant control; Fault-tolerant method; Open circuit faults; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114518024

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) covalently immobilized on the magnetic particles and the pH-sensitive liposomes encapsulating ferricyanide were added to a cyclic voltammetry cell solution where ACh was distributed. The conversion of ACh into acetic acid seemed to induce the pH decrease that caused the reduction in the electrostatic repulsion between the head groups of weakly acidic 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-succinate. The reduction generated liposome destabilization, which released potassium ferricyanide encapsulated inside the liposomes. The effects of the ACh concentration and pH were investigated. An addition of 10 μL of more than 0.5 mg/mL ACh concentration into 5 mL of a cyclic voltammetry cell solution was necessary to observe the response. The activity of AChE was reversible with respect to the pH change between 7 and 5. The sensitivity of this detection was almost identical to comparable techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, field-effect transistor, fluorescence, UV spectrometry, magnetic resonance imaging, and surface plasmon resonance.

Attributable to their solution processibility, tunable colour temperature, high quantum efficiency and high photostability, considerable research efforts have been spent on accumulating new insights into materials and device architecture design for high-performance QD WLEDs. At present, prevalent research on WLEDs focuses on using QDs as photoluminescence colour converters or using purely narrow linewidth QD LEDs to complement the white light spectrum, which is not energy efficient as well as challenging to achieve Eye Comfort ambient colour coding. Herein, a quantum composite made by hybridising perovskite (CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br1-xClx)3) and CuInS2 (CIS) QDs is proposed as a colour-encoded electroluminescent layer, which underpins good white colour temperature and bias stability for ambient lighting. Instead of using solely sharp emission QDs to match the white light spectrum, broad light emission spectrum CIS QDs are used for colour temperature tuning. In addition, the mixed-halide perovskite CsPb(Br1-xClx)3 QDs are successfully synthesised through a noninvasive halide ion exchange method associated with trimethylsilyl chloride additives, which provide a good colour purity in the blue and green electroluminescence regions. These designed QD composites enable the as-prepared WLED electroluminescence spectra to match the ideal ambient light Commission International de l'Éclairage 1931 (CIE) colour coordinates with a mean value of 0.33, 0.34. Moreover, the as-prepared WLEDs show a turn-on voltage of 4 V with negligibly small leakage current, good colour stability and electrical bias tolerance even under a broad range of driving voltages. Our results herald the advent of molecular level hybridisation of different quantum materials for high-performance electroluminescence white colour toning. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Additives; Bias voltage; Bromine compounds; Chlorine compounds; Color; Copper compounds; Electroluminescence; Emission spectroscopy; Energy efficiency; Flexible displays; Ion exchange; Lead compounds; Light; Light emitting diodes; Perovskite; Quantum efficiency; Semiconductor quantum dots; Electroluminescence spectra; Green electroluminescences; High quantum efficiency; Light emission spectra; Solution processibility; Trimethylsilyl chloride; White light emitting diodes; White lightemitting diodes (WLEDs); Color image processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107780103

ZnCl2 and Tiron are used as negative and positive active materials, which are dissolved in near-neutral pH, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) supporting electrolyte. Cell voltage of RFB using ZnCl2 and Tiron is extremely high as 1.8 V, while two cellulose spacers are introduced to prevent the growth of zinc dendrite on the membrane. When the performances of RFBs using ZnCl2 and Tiron are measured, their charge efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE), and energy efficiency (EE) are 95, 79, and 75% at 40 mA cm−2, whereas their capacity fading rate is high as 0.12 Ah L−1 per cycle. This is due to the zinc dendrite formed on the electrode of RFB that is attributed to the aggregation of zinc ions. To suppress the aggregation and to preserve active sites for the redox reaction of zinc ions during cycling, the polyethylene glycol (PEG) additive is suggested. Regarding the optimization of PEG, 5000 ppm PEG induces both high efficiencies (97, 81, and 79% of CE, VE, and EE at 40 mA cm−2) and low capacity loss rate (0.03 Ah L−1 per cycle), which are more enhanced performances than those of RFBs operated without PEG. In terms of power density of RFB using ZnCl2 and Tiron, high power density of 144 mW cm−2 is achieved under 120 mA cm−2, which is far better performance than that of other RFBs operated under near-neutral pH electrolyte. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aqueous organic redox flow battery; near-neutral pH supporting electrolyte; polyethylene glycol; quinone; zinc","Additives; Aliphatic compounds; Chlorine compounds; Electrolytes; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylenes; Redox reactions; Ammonium chloride; Capacity fading rates; Charge efficiency; High power density; Polyethylene glycol additives; Positive active materials; Supporting electrolyte; Voltage efficiencies; Zinc chloride; Additives; Aliphatic Compounds; Ammonium Chloride; Chlorine Compounds; Electrolytes; Redox Reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100907168

However, these prototypes and products are limited to a single material using the ME process due to technical challenges. Deposition of plastic on another dissimilar plastic substrate requires proper control of printing temperature during an ME process due to differences in melting temperatures of dissimilar plastics. In this paper, deposition of PLA filament on an ABS substrate during an ME process is investigated using finite element analysis. A heat transfer finite element (FE) model for the extrusion process is proposed to estimate the parameters of the ME machine for the formulation of a heat flux model. The effects of printing temperature and the stand-off distance on temperature distributions are investigated using the proposed FE model for the extrusion process. The heat flux model is implemented in a proposed heat transfer FE model of single bead deposition of PLA on an ABS plate. From this FE model of deposition, temperature histories during the ME deposition process are estimated. The results of temperature histories are compared with experiments. Using the calibrated FE model, a proper heating temperature of ABS for deposition of PLA is evaluated. © 2021 by the authors.

To cover all of these issues, advanced admittance controllers, such as those based on fuzzy logic or hedge algebras, have been formulated and successfully applied in several industrial problems. However, the inference mechanism of those kinds of controllers causes the discreteness of the super surface describing the input–output relationship in the Cartesian coordinates. As a consequence, the quality of the safe-natural cooperation between humans and robots is negatively affected. This paper presents an alternative admittance controller for pHRI by using a combination of hedge algebras and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), whose purpose is to create a more accurate inference mechanism for the admittance controller. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that such a neural network is considered for the inference mechanism of hedge algebras and also the first time that such an admittance controller is used for pHRI. The proposed admittance controller is verified on a teaching task using a 6-DOF manipulator.

Most importantly, if this practice is to be continued, the changes in adhesion strength of the tiles based on different adhesive application areas of adhesives must be clarified such that the very least secure application can be achieved even by using spot-bonding methods. In this regard, an experiment was conducted in this study where tile-adhered specimens with different adhesive-applied area ratios (AR) of 60 ± 2%, 80 ± 2%, and 100% were prepared. Tile adhesion strength was subsequently measured, after sectioning the entire surface of the tile into 40 pieces. Experimental results showed that the adhesion strength above the standard criteria could be achieved for about 75% of the entire tile with AR 100% conditioning, followed by 30% of the entire tile with AR 80 ± 2% conditioning, and 20% of the entire tile for AR 60 ± 2% conditioning. Further analysis showed that with AR 80 ± 2% and AR 60 ± 2% conditions, the overall adhesion strength decreased by the range of about 59–67% compared to the AR 100% application conditions. The results of the study intended to provide an analytical basis of guidelines and risks with the potential usage of spot-bonding and should only be used if AR 100% application is planned. © 2021 by the authors.

However, certain types of malware have applied anti-memory forensics techniques to evade memory analysis strategies or to make the acquisition process impossible. To disturb the acquisition process of physical memory, an attacker hooks the kernel API, which returns a map of the physical memory spaces, and modifies the return value of the API, specifically that typically used by memory acquisition tools. Moreover, an attacker modifies the kernel object referenced by the kernel API. This causes the system to crash during the memory acquisition process or causes the memory acquisition tools to incorrectly proceed with the acquisition. Even with a modification of one byte, called a one-byte modification attack, some tools fail to acquire memory. Therefore, specialized countermeasure techniques are needed for these anti-memory forensics techniques. In this paper, we propose a memory layout acquisition method which is robust to kernel API hooking and the one-byte modification attack on NumberOfRuns, the kernel object used to construct the memory layout in Windows. The proposed acquisition method directly accesses the memory, extracts the byte array, and parses it in the form of a memory layout. When we access the memory, we extract the _PHYSICAL_MEMORY_DESCRIPTOR structure, which is the basis of the memory layout without using the existing memory layout acquisition API. Furthermore, we propose a verification method that selects a reliable memory layout. We realize the verification method by comparing NumberOfRuns and the memory layout acquired via the kernel API, the registry, and the proposed method. The proposed verification method guarantees the reliability of the memory layout and helps secure memory image acquisition through a comparative verification with existing memory layout acquisition methods. We also conduct experiments to prove that the proposed method is resistant to anti-memory forensics techniques, confirming that there are no significant differences in time compared to the existing tools. © 2021 by the authors.

Samsung Securities, the Samsung conglomerate’s stock trading arm, mistakenly distributed shares worth over US$100 billion to its employees on April 6, 2018, due to a keyboard input error. The difficult process of finding a proper control group plagues comparative case studies. This study over-comes that hurdle by constructing a synthetic version of the event firm. It turns out that the company lost 12.17% (US$428 million) of its pre-event market capitaliza-tion, 3000 times the direct loss incurred, due to a fat finger mistake. The results highlight the importance of surveillance in curtailing unintended human errors such as incorrect keyboard inputs or mouse misclicks.

Herein, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with a unique hetero-shaped mesoporous structure were reported via decomposition of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and dissolution of ZnO nanoparticles during the carbonization process. To optimize electrochemical performance, the amount of ZnO nanoparticles was varied from 0 to 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 wt%. As a result, hetero-shaped mesoporous CNFs with 1.5 wt% ZnO nanoparticles (1.5ZnO-PCNF) exhibited the largest surface area of 691.6 m2 g−1, providing sufficient electrochemical active sites. Moreover, 1.5ZnO-PCNF showed the highest mesopore volume fraction of 92.5%, leading to fast ion diffusion kinetics. The optimized 1.5ZnO-PCNF electrode showed a specific capacitance of 120 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, 91.6% capacitance retention at a current density of 2 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability up to 3,000 cycles (maintaining 75.8% of capacitance after 3,000 cycles).

Three kinds of ZnO NP transformations were induced through interaction with sulfur (sulfidation) and phosphate (phosphation) and association with hydrous ferric oxide (Zn-FeOOH). Pristine and transformed ZnO NPs were characterized using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Changes in toxicity as a result of transformation were evaluated using an embryonic zebrafish assay. Toxicity was reduced in descending order by phosphation, sulfidation, and Zn-FeOOH with increasing molar ratios of S/Zn, PO4/Zn, and Fe/Zn, respectively. Reduced toxicity correlated well with the zinc concentration and addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid completely eliminated the toxicity, indicating that the remaining zinc ions in bulk solution were responsible for the toxicity of transformed ZnO NPs. The maximum toxicity reduction was observed after phosphation, attributable to the inhibition of zinc release by phosphates rapidly enclosing ZnO NPs. Zn-FeOOH does not effectively reduce the zinc concentration because no significant morphological changes occur during the transformation. We demonstrated that transformations modified the physicochemical properties of ZnO NPs, modulating their ability to reduce zinc ions, and governing toxicity to zebrafish embryos. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Association reactions; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Iron oxides; Molar ratio; Nanoparticles; Oxide minerals; Physicochemical properties; Zinc oxide; ZnO nanoparticles; Embryonic zebrafish; Hydrous ferric oxides; Morphological changes; Reduced toxicity; Toxicity reduction; Zebrafish embryos; Zinc concentration; Zinc oxide nanoparticles; Toxicity; bioassay; cyprinid; embryo; nanoparticle; phosphate; physicochemical property; sulfur; toxicity; transformation; transmission electron microscopy; X-ray diffraction; zinc; Danio rerio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108176732

This study used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage data (TWS), Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) precipitation data and Climate Research Unit (CRU) temperature data. Four general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 were downscaled using the best of four downscaling methods. Two machine learning (ML) models, RF and SVM, were developed to simulate GRACE TWS data for the period 2002–2016 and were then used for the projection of spatiotemporal changes in TWS. The projected TWS data were used to assess the spatiotemporal changes in water availability and sustainability based on the reliability–resiliency–vulnerability (RRV) concept. This study revealed that linear scaling was the best for downscaling over Nigeria. RF had better performance than SVM in modeling TWS for the study area. This study also revealed there would be decreases in water storage during the wet season (June–September) and increases in the dry season (January–May). Decreases in projected water availability were in the range of 0–12 mm for the periods 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099 under RCP2.6 and in the range of 0–17 mm under RCP8.5 during the wet season. Spatially, annual changes in water storage are expected to increase in the northern part and decrease in the south, particularly in the country’s southeast. Groundwater sustainability was higher during the period 2070–2099 under all RCPs compared to the other periods and this can be attributed to the expected increases in rainfall during this period. © 2021 by the authors.

Meanwhile, the diesel generator can be combined with a photovoltaic (PV) system and Battery Energy Storage (BES) system to form a hybrid power generation system to reduce the energy cost and increase renewable energy penetration. For this, proper sizing of each power generation component is required, one of which is influenced by the applied control strategy. This paper proposes an optimal BES dispatch (OBD) control strategy that optimizes the power generation components’ sizing. The method examines the shortcomings of the other popular control strategies, such as load following, cycle charging, or combination. The optimization objectives are to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and maximize the renewable energy (RE) penetration, which can be achieved by prioritizing the BES to supply the load over other available generations and charge the BES every time the generator operates. The proposed method is implemented at two different systems with different load profiles. As a result, the proposed control strategy provides lower LCOE while maintaining higher RE penetration than the other control strategies in both locations. © 2021 by the authors.

The equations of motion of the FPSE are formulated as a 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) vibration system of the power piston (PP) and displacer piston (DP), based on the state equation of ideal gas and the isothermal Stirling cycle model. The dynamic models of FPSE we considered are the 1-DOF simple vibration model of each piston and the 2-DOF root locus model of coupled pistons. We developed a test FPSE for verification of the dynamic models and conducted a series of experiments to measure the dynamic behaviors of PP and DP under varying charge pressures for various masses and stiffnesses of the PP. As a result, both prediction models showed good agreements with experimental results. The 1-DOF vibration model was found to be simple and effective for predicting the operating frequency and charge pressure of FPSE. The root locus method showed reasonable predictions with an operation criterion of the PP-DP phase angle of 90°. In addition, the FPSE was confirmed to operate in resonant oscillations when the DP-PP phase angle is 90°, based on analysis of the force vector diagram of the two pistons. © 2021 by the authors.

Until now, to analyze asymptotic stability, we have modeled a timed event graph’s dynamic behavior, transformed it into the matrix form of (max,+) algebra, and then constructed a precedence graph. This article’s aim is to provide a theoretical basis for analyzing the stability and cyclicity of timed event graphs without using (max,+) algebra. In this article, we propose converting one timed event graph to another with a dynamic behavior equivalent to that of the original without going through the conversion process. This paper also guarantees that the derived final timed event graph has the properties of a precedence graph. It then investigates the relationship between the properties of the derived precedence graph and that of the original timed event graph. Finally, we propose a method to analyze asymptotic cyclicity and stability for a given timed event graph by itself.

Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may cause insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. As commercial hypoglycemic drugs have side effects, it is necessary to develop safe and effective natural compound-based hypoglycemic treatments. This study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic effects of Mori Ramulus ethanol extract (ME) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes mouse model to decipher the underlying mechanisms focusing on apoptosis and mitochondrial function. ME significantly decreased tunicamycin-induced apoptotic cell death and increased insulin secretion following glucose stimulation in NIT-1 pancreatic β-cells. Tunicamycin-exposed NIT-1 pancreatic β-cells showed elevated reactive oxygen species levels and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, which were reversed by ME treatment. ME inhibited the tunicamycin-induced apoptosis cascade in tunicamycin-exposed NIT-1 pancreatic β-cells. In HFD diabetic mice, the serum-free fatty acid and insulin levels decreased following a 15-week ME administration. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed that ME improved insulin sensitivity. Moreover, ME ameliorated pancreatic β-cell mass loss in diabetic mice. Finally, ME-treated HFD-fed mice showed improved hepatic mitochondrial function resulting in insulin sensitivity in target tissues. Thus, ME provides protection against pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and prevents insulin resistance by improving mitochondrial function. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Emulsions were created using blends of nonionic ethoxylated fatty acid alcohol surfactants with different hydrophilic head sizes, and lipophilic (TBHQ) and amphiphilic (lauryl gallate) antioxidants were incorporated into the emulsions. At the same surfactant concentration, emulsion stabilized with surfactant with a smaller hydrophilic head was more susceptible to lipid oxidation than that stabilized with surfactant with a larger hydrophilic head. When surfactants with a similar hydrophilic head size were used, lipid oxidation in emulsion containing more surfactant was slightly faster than that containing less surfactant. When emulsions were created with a 1:1 molar ratio mixture of surfactants with small and large hydrophilic heads, surfactant concentration (1.00 and 2.932 mM) had little effect on lipid peroxide generation rate. However, the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARSs) in the emulsion prepared at 1.00 mM increased faster than that prepared at 2.93 mM. Alteration of interfacial composition and surfactant concentration did not affect antioxidant ability, regardless of antioxidant polarity, to inhibit lipid peroxide generation. However, the ability of lauryl gallate and TBHQ to prevent TBARS generation was elevated by mixing surfactants with small and large hydrophilic heads and by decreasing surfactant concentration. In most emulsions, lauryl gallate showed a more effective antioxidant ability than TBHQ. © 2021 by the authors.","Antioxidants; Emulsions; Interfacial composition; Lipid oxidation; Polarity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107134879

Initially, a co‐planar waveguide‐fed triangular monopole antenna is obtained with a wide operational frequency band ranging from 4.0 GHz to 7.8 GHz. Then, two additional stubs are connected to the triangular monopole through two p‐i‐n diodes. By electrically switching these p‐i‐n diodes ON and OFF, different operating frequency bands can be attained. When turning ON only one diode, the antenna offers dual‐band operations of 3.3–4.2 GHz and 5.8–7.2 GHz. Meanwhile, the antenna with single‐band operation from 3.3 GHz to 4.2 GHz can be realized when both of the p‐i‐n diodes are switched to ON states. The proposed compact size antenna with dimensions of 0.27λ0 × 0.16λ0 × 0.017λ0 at the lower operating frequency (3.3 GHz) can be used for several wireless applications such as worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), wireless access in the vehicular environment (WAVE), and wireless local area network (WLAN).

Motion, as well as scene appearance, are essential features to estimate a driver’s visual attention allocation in computer vision. However, the fact that motion can be a crucial factor in a driver’s attention estimation has not been thoroughly studied in the literature, although driver’s attention prediction models focusing on scene appearance have been well studied. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the usefulness of motion information in estimating a driver’s visual attention. To analyze the effectiveness of motion information, we develop a deep neural network framework that provides attention locations and attention levels using optical flow maps, which represent the movements of contents in videos. We validate the performance of the proposed motion-based prediction model by comparing it to the performance of the current state-of-art prediction models using RGB frames. The experimental results for a real-world dataset confirm our hypothesis that motion plays a role in prediction accuracy improvement, and there is a margin for accuracy improvement by using motion features. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous research in this area has focused on hot and cold weather conditions: hot weather causes heat rash, heat cramps and heat fainting, while cold weather causes fatigue, lumbago, and cold finger sensations. However, other weather conditions are also associated with, and cause, fatal injury and accidents. Accordingly, this study analyzes injury and fatal accidents in the construction industry based on the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) as it pertains to thermal comfort using an uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, using a neural network, relative importance is analyzed considering injury and fatal accidents. This study is conducted in five steps: (i) Establishment of the data-base, (ii) Classification of accident types and weather conditions, (iii) Calculation of thermal com-fort, (iv) Analysis of injury and fatal accidents based on thermal comfort, and (v) Calculation of the relative importance of thermal comfort during injury and fatal accidents. Via the research process, 5317 fatal incidents and 207,802 injuries are analyzed according to 18 accident types in all seasons. It was found that ‘falls’, were the most frequent fatal incident and injury (2804 fatal incidents and 71,017 injuries), with most of these occurring during the autumn season. The probabilities of injury and fatal accidents in the ‘fall’ category are 86.01% and 85.60%, respectively, in the outside comfort ranges.

Herein, we demonstrate a simple, fast, cost-effective and scalable one-step process based on an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for the synthesis of black TiO2-x microspheres. The process utilizes an oxygen-deficient environment during the pyrolysis of titanium precursors to directly introduce oxygen vacancies into synthesized TiO2 products, and thus a reduction step is not required. Droplets of a titanium precursor solution were generated by ultrasound energy and dragged with continuous N2 flow into a furnace for the decomposition of the precursor and crystallization to TiO2 and through such a process spherical black TiO2-x microspheres were obtained at 900 °C. The synthesized black TiO2-x microsphere with trivalent titanium/oxygen vacancy clearly showed the variation of physicochemical properties compared with those of white TiO2. In addition, the synthesized microspheres presented the superior photocatalytic activity for degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation.

They have been widely investigated for optical applications such as holograms, wavefront shaping, and structural color printing, however, electron-beam lithography is not suitable to produce large-area metasurfaces because of the high fabrication cost and low productivity. Although alternative optical technologies, such as holographic lithography and plasmonic lithography, can overcome these drawbacks, such methods are still constrained by the optical diffraction limit. To break through this fundamental problem, mechanical nanopatterning processes have been actively studied in many fields, with nanoimprint lithography (NIL) coming to the forefront. Since NIL replicates the nanopattern of the mold regardless of the diffraction limit, NIL can achieve sufficiently high productivity and patterning resolution, giving rise to an explosive development in the fabrication of metasurfaces. In this review, we focus on various NIL technologies for the manufacturing of metasurfaces. First, we briefly describe conventional NIL and then present various NIL methods for the scalable fabrication of metasurfaces. We also discuss recent applications of NIL in the realization of metasurfaces.

In recent years, CNN that is known to be outstanding to handle large volumes of data, it is has been in the spotlight to solve the problems of sensor defects and data loss, which may have resulted from the limitations of the current structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques. However, although the architecture of CNN should be constructed differently depending on the characteristics of each problem, there is no rational nor reasonable method for the construction of the architecture. In this regard, this study seeks to propose a technique for constructing an optimal architecture for the effective utilization of CNN in recovery and estimation of measured data dealt in the field of SHM. In the proposed technique, the number of kernels, the kernel size, and the subsampling size are set as the decision variables, among the variables that determine the CNN architecture. To prevent CNN from being trained with bias toward specific datasets, root mean square errors are calculated for each of the training datasets and validation datasets, and set as objective functions, respectively. Then these two objective functions are minimized at the same time. In this case, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, is introduced to minimize these two objective functions. The proposed technique is verified by a numerical study on beam-like structures and an experimental study on reinforced concrete structures. These two studies explore the optimal CNN architecture, which estimates the dynamic strain of the structure, and evaluates the performance of the explored architecture. © 2021","Convolutional neural network; Data prediction; Dynamic structural response; Measurement; Multi-objective optimization; Structural health monitoring","Convolution; Deep learning; Genetic algorithms; Mean square error; Memory architecture; Multiobjective optimization; Network architecture; Neural networks; Structural optimization; Convolutional neural network; Data prediction; Dynamic structural response; Health monitoring; Multi-objectives optimization; Neural network architecture; Objective functions; Optimal architecture; Structural health; Structural response; Structural health monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103384079

To reduce the need for such enormous data transfers, the combined function of IoT sensors and near-sensor artificial neural networks can process data properly before they are transferred to cloud servers. Herein, energy-efficient memristor crossbar arrays are demonstrated for image recognition tasks that are potentially adopted for IoT sensors. The adoption of the selector-free memristor device with a self-rectifying function allows for simple stacking of metal–dielectric–metal layer, thus significantly simplifying the fabrication process while achieving low-current operation (<10 µA in microdevice). Area-dependent resistive switching characteristics and the incorporation of interface effects reveal the role of the switching and rectifying phenomena in such devices. Finally, the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition task is demonstrated with 32 × 32 memristor crossbar arrays combining a SPICE simulation.

Owing to the rapid development of social media, methodologies and frameworks facilitating a competitor analysis through online reviews have recently been proposed. However, existing studies have only focused on the detection of comparative sentences in review comments. Thus, product developers compare the competitive factors only within identical feature dimensions of a product. This study proposes a novel approach to identifying the competitive factors at the comprehensive level of the product features—in other words, the focus is on the points of differentiation of each product as perceived by customers using an explainable neural network. We assume that keywords, which have a significant influence on the classification decision, are considered meaningful points of differentiation by consumers. Thus, we establish a classification model to classify the review comments for each corresponding product and calculate the weight of importance of each keyword in such comments during the classification process. We then extract and prioritize the keywords to determine the competitiveness based on the weight of importance. The experiment results show that our proposed method effectively extracts the competitive factors in both qualitative and quantitative experiments. This is the first study on extracting competitive factors with an explainable neural network based on customer reviews; future studies may extend the scope of the extraction of such factors using an explainable neural network. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aspect extraction; Competitive factors; Competitor analysis; Explainable neural network; Grad-CAM; TV","Decision making; Extraction; Factor analysis; Classification decision; Classification models; Classification process; Competitive factor; Competitor analysis; Management decision-making; Product developers; Quantitative experiments; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103182799

This Tris-CNT is synthesized by a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of carboxylic acid functionalized carbon nanotube (CA-CNT) and the amine group of Tris. Since one Tris molecule has three hydroxyl groups, the surface of Tris-CNT consists of abundant oxygen functional groups that play a key role in facilitating the redox reaction of vanadium ions. To confirm the viability of Tris-CNT as a catalyst for VRFB, its chemical and electrochemical properties are evaluated. As a result, the reactivity of Tris-CNT increases by 136 and 159% for V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+ reactions when compared to those of CA-CNT.

Despite these remarkable properties, TMDs exhibit fast capacity fading and insufficient Li storage kinetics, owing to the excessive volume expansion and low electric/ionic transfer rate. The aim of this study is to reinforce the structural stability and Li storage kinetics of TMDs through the use of well-dispersed CoS2 and WS2 ultrasmall particles (USPs) embedded in hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers, including micro/mesoporous composite sturctures. As expected, this architecture offers a high specific capacity (718.0 mAh g−1) with the capacity retention of 93.4% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 owing to increased Li storage sites and prevention of volume expansion of CoS2 and WS2 USPs. In particular, a remarkable fast discharge capacity (444.5 mAh g−1) with the capacity retention of 90.2% after 1000 cycles are noted. These results are related to the high number of Li ion storage sites, effective prevention of volume expansion of well-dispersed CoS2 and WS2 USPs, short Li ion diffusion length, and favorable Li ion acceptability, which is caused by the hierarchical porous structure containing meso/micropores. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cobalt disulfide; Mesopores; Micropores; Tungsten disulfide; Ultrafast lithium ion batteries","Anodes; Carbon nanofibers; Cobalt compounds; Composite structures; Expansion; Ions; Kinetics; Lithium-ion batteries; Porous materials; Stability; Storage (materials); Sulfur compounds; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Capacity retention; Hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers; Hierarchical porous structures; High specific capacity; Hybrid composites; Structural stabilities; Theoretical capacity; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101497048

BGEI showed the highest pull-off strength during exposure to tap water (3.78 MPa) and seawater (3.66 MPa). However, adding phenolic novolac resin and hexanediol diglycidyl ether, which were reactive diluents, reduced the pull-off strength during tap water exposure compared to that observed during seawater exposure, owing to the penetration of tap water.

We present the first report on the thermal conductivity of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited (PEALD) HZO thin films. Steady-state thermoreflectance measures the effective thermal conductivity of undoped and yttrium-doped HZO films and their interfaces. The effective thermal conductivity of the undoped film is found to be 0.75 W m–1 K–1, which is comparable to those reported previously for thermal ALD HZO films with similar composition. With increasing yttrium doping level, the effective thermal conductivity slightly decreases down to 0.67 W m–1 K–1 owing to dopant scattering of phonons.

However, despite extensive research on the interfacial engineering of electrode materials, studies on the interface design between the electrode and current collector to improve the ultrafast cycling performance are rare. In this study, we designed a novel interface architecture for a fluorine-doped carbon quantum dot (F-CQD) interfacial layer on a stockade-like etched Cu foil via electrochemical modification and a spray coating process. The anode electrode assembled with the resultant Cu foil showed enhanced adhesion, high reaction kinetics, and excellent interface stability between the electrode and Cu foil due to the F-CQD interfacial layer on the stockade-like etched Cu foil, leading to an improved ultrafast cycling performance. Consequently, the novel architecture of a Cu foil having stockade-like etching patterns with an F-CQD interfacial layer showed an increased ultrafast cycling capacity of 82.9 mAh g−1 and excellent ultrafast cycling stability of 94.1% after 500 cycles under ultrafast cycling conditions. These improved ultrafast cycling performances are due to the high contact area between the electrode and Cu foil, excellent reaction sites, and superb corrosion resistance. © 2020","Copper foil; Current collector; Interfacial engineering; Surface modification; Ultrafast lithium ion batteries","Anodes; Carbon; Copper corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Etching; Fluorine; Ions; Metal cladding; Nanocrystals; Reaction kinetics; Semiconductor quantum dots; Cycling conditions; Cycling performance; Electrochemical modification; Electrode material; Interface architecture; Interface engineering; Interface stabilities; Spray coating process; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095838732

Although the characteristics of the different layers in a CNN are frequently quite different, previous hardware designs have employed common optimization schemes for them. This paper proposes a layer-specific design that employs different organizations that are optimized for the different layers. The proposed design employs two layer-specific optimizations: layer-specific mixed data flow and layer-specific mixed precision. The mixed data flow aims to minimize the off-chip access while demanding a minimal on-chip memory (BRAM) resource of an FPGA device. The mixed precision quantization is to achieve both a lossless accuracy and an aggressive model compression, thereby further reducing the off-chip access. A Bayesian optimization approach is used to select the best sparsity for each layer, achieving the best trade-off between the accuracy and compression. This mixing scheme allows the entire network model to be stored in BRAMs of the FPGA to aggressively reduce the off-chip access, and thereby achieves a significant performance enhancement. The model size is reduced by 22.66-28.93 times compared to that in a full-precision network with a negligible degradation of accuracy on VOC, COCO, and ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, the combination of mixed dataflow and mixed precision significantly outperforms the previous works in terms of both throughput, off-chip access, and on-chip memory requirement. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Bayesian optimization; coarse-grained quantization; mixed data flow; Mixed precision; mixed precision convolution","Clustering algorithms; Convolutional neural networks; Data transfer; Economic and social effects; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Object detection; Bayesian optimization; Different layers; Model compression; Network modeling; Object detectors; Optimization scheme; Performance enhancements; Processing speed; Integrated circuit design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090459067

Co(TiPA) is optimal catholyte due to excellent redox reactivity and stability, while such benefits are proved by the comparison of formation constant which is proportional to the strength of coordination bonds within metal complex. That of Co(TiPA) is 10.8 times higher than that of Co(DIPSO) that is a competitor for catholyte. Regarding anolyte, Fe(DIPSO) formed by 1:1.5 mol ratio of Fe ion to DIPSO ligand is more stable than Fe(TiPA) that is a competitor for anolyte. The stability is experimentally verified by linear sweep voltamogram. According to the measurements, In Fe(DIPSO), potential required for the solidification of Fe ions, which causes the performance degradation of AMORFB, is placed more negatively than that required in Fe(TiPA). This indicates the when Fe(DIPSO) is used, the stable cut-off voltage range for AMORFB tests is extended with its performance improvement. Furthermore, since the solidified Fe further acts as catalyst for undesirable hydrogen evolution reaction, retarding the solidification of Fe ions enhances the performance and stability of AMORFB. In in-situ AMORFB cell tests performed to validify the electrochemical evaluations of metal complexes, the stability of AMORFB using Co(TiPA) and Fe(DIPSO) is best. Regarding its performance, charge capacity is high as 15.5 Ah L−1, while its capacity loss rate is low as 0.018 Ah L−1cyc−1 for 100 cycles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Formation constant; In-situ analysis of battery; Organometallic complex; Redox flow battery","Cobalt; Coordination reactions; Electrolytes; Flow batteries; Ions; Iron; Metal complexes; Solidification; Stability; Anolytes; Cobalt-based; Fe-ions; Formation constants; In-situ analyse of battery; Iron-based; Optimisations; Organometallic complex; Performance; Redox couple; Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103324568

These deformations, however, leave symmetries and topologies largely intact, limiting the multifunctional horizon. Here, we present topology manipulation of metamaterials fabricated on flexible substrates by mechanically closing/opening embedded nanotrenches of various geometries. When an inner bending is applied on the substrate, the nanotrench closes and the accompanying topological change results in abrupt switching of metamaterial functionalities such as resonance, chirality, and polarization selectivity. Closable nanotrenches can be embedded in metamaterials of broadband spectrum, ranging from visible to microwave.

The proposed converter is composed of a three-phase PWM converter and a three-phase dual active bridge (DAB) converter through circuit integration. The low frequency component that is inevitably generated in the process of ac-dc power conversion is absorbed by low frequency blocking capacitor (LFBC) connected in series with the transformer wingding, and the low frequency component is almost not applied to transformer, resulting in enabling high frequency isolation. Also, power factor correction (PFC) and bidirectional power control are performed by two control variables, amplitude modulation index and phase shift angle, and soft switching of all switching devices is possible even in continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation. A prototype was built and experimental results are obtained and discussed in order to verify validity of proposed concept. © 2021 IEEE.","high frequency isolation; insert; Single-stage conversion; soft-switching; styling","DC transformers; Electric inverters; Electrolytic capacitors; Energy conversion; Power control; Ac-dc power conversion; Bi-directional power control; Continuous-conduction-mode operations; Dual active bridges; Electrolytic capacitor-less; High-frequency isolation; Low-frequency components; Power factor corrections; Rectifying circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114214100

MnIII complexes catalysed efficiently various olefin epoxidation reactions with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) under the mild condition. MnIII complexes 1a and 1c with the electron-withdrawing group -Cl and electron-donating group –CH3 showed little substituent effect on the epoxidation reactions.

However, most studies reported its mitochondrial toxicity with respect to a single form, which is far from the environmentally relevant conditions. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to five OCPs: chlordane, heptachlor, p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p’-DDT), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), as well as an equal ratio mixture of these OCPs. We evaluated mitochondrial function, including oxygen consumption, the activity of mitochondrial complexes, antioxidant reactions, and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. Oxygen consumption rate was reduced by exposure to chlordane, and β-HCH, linking to the increased activity of specific mitochondrial complex I and III, and decreased GSH level. We found that these mitochondrial dysfunctions were more significant in the exposure to the OCP mixture than the individual OCPs. On the mRNA transcription level, the individual OCPs mainly dysregulated the metabolic cycle (i.e., cs and acadm), whereas the OCP mixture disrupted the genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., sdha). Consequently, we demonstrate that the OCP mixture disrupts mitochondrial metabolism by a different molecular mechanism than the individual OCPs, which warrants further study to evaluate mitochondrial dysregulation by chronic exposure to the OCP mixture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Mitochondrial toxicity; Mixture; Organochlorine pesticide; Zebrafish","Metabolism; Mitochondria; Mixtures; Oxygen; Pesticides; Transcription; Condition; Hexachlorocyclohexanes; Mitochondrial complex; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Mitochondrial metabolism; Mitochondrial toxicity; Organochlorine pesticides; Pesticide mixture; Zebrafish; Zebrafish embryos; Toxicity; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; chlordane; chlorphenotane; glutathione; heptachlor; hexachlorobenzene; messenger RNA; organochlorine pesticide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; chlorinated hydrocarbon; chlorphenotane; pesticide; cyprinid; embryonic development; experimental study; gene expression; laboratory method; mitochondrial DNA; organochlorine pesticide; physiological response; pollution exposure; Article; bioenergy; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; embryo; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; gene expression; genetic transcription; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen consumption rate; zebra fish; animal; mitochondrion; Danio rerio; Animals; DDT; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Mitochondria; Pesticides; Zebrafish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102359831

For the training and testing of the XGBoost model, which was developed using the XGBoost 1.1.1 package, 497 experimental data of interior slab–column connections were collected from the literature. The input variables were the column section dimension, slab effective depth, concrete compressive strength, steel yield strength, and reinforcement ratio at the top and bottom of the slab. The targeted output variable was the punching shear strength. First, the developed XGBoost model was compared with two other machine learning (ML) models that incorporate artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). All three ML models could reliably estimate the punching shear resistance of the considered type of R/C slabs, but the XGBoost model generally achieved the best prediction. Second, the performance of the developed XGBoost model was compared to various design codes and empirical models. The XGBoost model presented the most accurate prediction among them with the coefficient of determination (R2) for the testing dataset being equal to 0.9578. Third, the relative significance of input variables in the prediction of punching shear resistance was examined. The effective depth was shown to have the most significant role in the punching shear prediction.

However, the difficulties in distributing the nanoparticles in the thermoelectric material matrix homogeneously have been the main problem.

Furthermore, the ionic/electrical properties of WS2, which can improve ultrafast cycling performance, can be effectively enhanced by its unique metallic phase (1T-WS2). Despite these significant advantages, the application of WS2 anodes is limited by critical issues such as large volume expansion and poor ultrafast cycling performance, because the control and synthesis of nano-sized 1T-WS2 crystals is difficult. Therefore, to improve the ultrafast and ultrastable Li storage of LIBs, herein, a novel architecture comprising 1T-WS2 quantum dots (QDs) embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) with multihollow capillary bundle-type mesopores is proposed. This novel hierarchical hybrid nanostructure exhibits a high specific capacity (716.5 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1) and an outstanding rate capability, because of increased Li-ion storage sites and fast Li-ion diffusion and significant ultrafast cycling capacity (528.1 mAh g−1) and long-term cycling stability (87.8% after 1000 cycles) under ultrafast cycling conditions (2000 mA g−1). The increase in the Li storage sites is attributed to the high specific capacity due to the well-dispersed 1T-WS2 QDs in the PCNFs; the increased Li-ion transfer rate is attributed to the high rate capability due to the multihollow capillary bundle-type mesopores; the long-term cycling stability is attributed to the WS2 QDs embedded within the PCNFs, which effectively prevent volume expansion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon nanofibers; Hollow capillary bundle mesopores; Tungsten disulfide quantum dots; Ultrafast and ultrastable lithium storage","Anodes; Carbon nanofibers; Expansion; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanocrystals; Semiconductor quantum dots; Storage (materials); Sulfur compounds; Transition metals; Cycling performance; High rate capability; High specific capacity; Hybrid nanostructures; Mesoporous carbon nanofibers; Novel architecture; Specific capacities; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Tungsten compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099972565

A cellulose filter (CF) was used as a support, and its surface was modified using acrylic acid to enhance copper immobilization. The modified filter (CF-AA) exhibited 10x higher copper adsorption than the unmodified filter. Cu/Cu2O was prepared on CF-AA by using a simple hydrothermal method to obtain CF-AA-Cu, and the prepared Cu/Cu2O was characterized with scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. While CF and Cu2O themselves exhibited limited iodide adsorption performance, CF-AA-Cu exhibited fast adsorption kinetics with a half-life of 60 min as well as a high adsorption capacity of 10.32 mg/g, as obtained using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. Moreover, it exhibited high selectivity for iodide when high concentrations of other anions were present. The adsorption mechanism was proved by means of material characterization before and after adsorption.

The two-dimensional Stream-Tube Routing Procedure (2D ST-RP) has been widely used to obtain the dispersion coefficients from measured concentration-time curves under the frozen cloud assumption. Meanwhile, the Spatial Routing Procedure (2D S-RP) employs the spatial distributions of concentration to estimate the dispersion coefficients. The performance of the two routing methods were evaluated in aspect of the validity of the frozen cloud assumption and the applicability in the non-Fickian mixing. From the estimation results of dispersion coefficients, the results by the 2D ST-RP included errors due to skewed concentration-time curves which were created by violating the frozen cloud assumption. On the other hand, the 2D S-RP provides accurate dispersion coefficients in the same condition. The estimated results of dispersion coefficients in the meandering channel show that both the 2D ST-RP and the 2D S-RP contained errors due to the non-Fickian mixing properties of the test case. Even with the discrepancies, the 2D S-RP presented more appropriate spatial variabilities along the meander cycle than the results by the 2D ST-RP. © 2021 by the authors.

When the HPFP that pressurizes the fuel by a reciprocating piston operates, the pressure of the delivered fuel pulsates. If the fuel rail pressure (FRP) pulsation increases past a certain point, the fluctuation of the fuel injection rate also increases and the parts may be damaged. The FRP pulsation induced by a HPFP was computer simulated. The mitigation effect of the FRP pulsation with an orifice connecting the HPFP outlet and the fuel rail was investigated. Fuel pressure waves at both the HPFP outlet and the fuel rail were simulated according to changes of the opening and closing timing of a PCV (pressure control valve) in the HPFP. The signal-to-noise ratio from the simulated pressure wave was calculated. The fuel injection rate was also simulated. Three cases of fuel rail pressure conditions were used in the simulation: 50, 100, and 150 bar. In addition, four different engine speed conditions were used: 1500, 3000, 4500, and 6000 rpm. Three orifice diameters were also used: 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 mm. When the PCV opening time came before the TDC and the engine speed was high, the pressure pulsation and injected fuel mass variation were appeared to belarge. When the PCV opening time was later than the TDC, there was no pressure pulsation and little variation in the injected fuel mass for all simulation condition. © 2006–2021.

Recently, two types of piezoelectric devices, ceramic-PDMS composite film and PVDF nanofiber mats, have drawn attention in the research community. Piezoelectric ceramics such as BaTiO3 (BTO) and PZT exhibit outstanding piezoelectric coefficients, while PDMS provides flexibility. In contrast, a PVDF nanofiber mat simultaneously exhibits piezoelectricity and flexibility. In the present study, a comparative analysis of BTO-PDMS composite film and a PVDF nanofiber mat for application to flexible pressure sensors was carried out. First, step-wise electric poling was conducted on these two types of pressure sensors, after which the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was measured under compressive force. The 1.8 V peak-to-peak Voc was measured in a BTO-PDMS composite with a 30 wt.% BTO content that was poled by 10 kV/mm electric field for 15 min. This peak-to-peak Voc of the BTO-PDMS composite increased further to ~ 4 V when it was poled for 24 hr. Unlike the BTO-PDMS composite films, the maximum Voc (1.1 V) was measured in a PVDF nanofiber mat that did not undergo subsequent electric poling. A BTO-PDMS composite film and a PVDF nanofiber mat were fabricated, and the compressive force and strain-rate dependencies of Voc and the short-circuit current (Isc) were investigated. Overall, the Voc and Isc of the BTO-PDMS composite film exceeded those of the PVDF nanofiber mat in a force range of 1 − 25 N and frequency range of 0.5 − 2.0 Hz. However, the Voc and Isc signals from the PVDF nanofiber mat were more stable than those from the BTO-PDMS composite film due to the longer lifetime of the signals.

The distillation process requires the optimization and the prediction of operation because it consumes much energy. The target process of this study is difficult to operate efficiently because the composition of feed flow is not steady according to the supplier. To deal with this problem, we could develop a data-driven model to predict operating conditions. However, data preprocessing is essential to improve the predictive performance of the model because the raw data contains outlier and noise. In this study, after optimizing the predictive model based long-short term memory (LSTM) and Random forest (RF), we used a low-pass filter and one-class support vector machine for data preprocessing and compared predictive performance according to the method and range of the preprocessing. The performance of the predictive model and the effect of the preprocessing is compared by using R2and RMSE. In the case of LSTM, R2increased from 0.791 to 0.977 by 23.5%, and RMSE decreased from 0.132 to 0.029 by 78.0%.

However, these alone have limitations in delivering the realistic sense of weight to the users when interacting with virtual objects of different weights, which requires improvement. Methods Based on the threshold experiment on weight perception, this study designed and implemented the moment controller, a device that can deliver weight, and developed a VR game to compare the weight of virtual objects on both arms scales. In addition, five different situations were classified, including the appearance of a virtual object, the difference in weight, and whether the expected weight and actual weight of the virtual object were matched. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the moment controller by performing the two-arm scale game in each of the five situations. Results The results of the experiment showed that participants felt more realistic when they felt the weight matching the visual appearance of a virtual object, and unrealistic when they felt the opposite weight. In particular, the task resulted in the longest time under the opposite weight. In addition, the enjoyment score was highest when the weight matching the appearance of the virtual object was applied. Conclusions The moment controller has shown the potential to increase the sense of weight perception to users interacting with virtual objects, and is expected to enhance the sense of immersion of users experiencing virtual environments. © 2021.

This situation has led to a rapid increase in social atomization and it is necessary to reconsider the mission of multicultural public spaces. This article aims to provide suggestions on the design direction of multicultural public spaces in the increasingly atomized future world through a literature review and case studies. Methods This article reviews the literature on social atomization. The atomization of society is caused by the lack of social connections. With the development of society, the atomization of society has become a new challenge. Multicultural public spaces design in the post-epidemic era is still a relatively new research field. Therefore, this article combines representative examples of multicultural spaces, comprehensively considers the trend of modern society, and provides new ideas for the development of multicultural spaces under the background of social atomization. Results In this way, the designer must ensure that the task of the space takes into account the different needs of people, while providing the possibility to enjoy the space alone or by multiple people, so as to rebuild the connection between the individual and the society, and even build a vibrant intermediary community. Conclusions The concept of social atomization provides a new perspective with which to understand public spaces in a multicultural environment.

Laundry facilities, using petroleum-based organic solvents, are one of the sources of VOCs emissions. However, little is known about the significance of VOCs, emitted from laundry facilities, in the ozone and SOA generation. In this study, we characterized VOCs emission from a dry-cleaning process using petroleum-based organic solvents. We also assessed the impact of the VOCs on air quality by using photochemical ozone creation potential and secondary organic aerosol potential. Among 94 targeted compounds including toxic organic air pollutants and ozone precursors, 36 compounds were identified in the exhaust gas from a drying machine. The mass emitted from one cycle of drying operation (40 min) was the highest in decane (2.04 g/dry cleaning). Decane, nonane, and n-undecane were the three main contributors to ozone generation (more than 70% of the total generation). N-undecane, decane, and n-dodecane were the three main contributors to the SOA generation (more than 80% of the total generation).

An-tioxidant activity was determined using the ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays. The antilipidemic effect was evaluated in palmitic acid-induced steatosis in HepG2 hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cellular lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil Red O staining and a cellular triglyceride content assay. All analyzed WGEs showed significant antioxidant potential, although some bioactive com-pounds, such as carotenoids, tocopherols, and γ-oryzanol, were the highest in the ethanol extract. Correlation analysis revealed the antioxidant potential of all identified biogenic amines except for spermidine. Ethanol and n-hexane extracts significantly inhibited cellular lipid accumulation in cell models. These results suggest that WGEs exhibit promising antioxidant potential, with a variety of bioactive compounds. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest that bioactive compounds in WGEs attenuate plasma lipid and oxidation levels.

Animals were fed distilled water or 1×109 colony-forming unit/kg B.W. 200655 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as a positive control for 14 days. An in vivo model of immunosuppression was induced using CP 150 and 100 mg/kg B.W. at 7 and 10 days, respectively. Body weight, spleen index, spleen weight, and gene expression were measured to estimate the immune-enhancing effects. The dead 200655 (D-200655) group showed an increased spleen weight compared to the sham control (SC) group. Similarly, the spleen index was significantly higher than that in the CP-Treated group. The live 200655 (L-200655) group showed an increased mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-Alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 in splenocytes. Also, the iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the L-200655 group compared to the CP-only (SC) group. The phosphorylation of ERK and MAPK was also upmodulated in the L-200655 group. These results indicate that L. plantarum 200655 ameliorated CP-induced immune suppression, suggesting that L. plantarum 200655 may have the potential to enhance the immune system. © 2021 Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

There-fore, a Python code was developed to determine an optimal ANN structure by tracking the train-ing/prediction errors of the ANN as a function of the number of hidden layers and nodes of hidden layers. The optimal ANN was trained using 484 output current (I)–load resistance (R) datasets obtained under three different engine rotation speeds and five different engine loads. The prediction accuracy of the ANN was validated by comparing 88 I–R datasets reproduced by the ANN using experimental data that were not used for training. In the validation procedure, differences of only 3.49% and 2.59% were observed in the experimental and ANN-predicted output power obtained for the 1000 rpm–0.8 MPa brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and 1500 rpm–0.4 MPa BMEP scenarios, respectively. The exhaust gas flow characteristics were used for training and validation to predict the pumping loss caused by the installation of the TEG in the middle of the exhaust tailpipe with high accuracy. The results demonstrated that the ANN effectively reproduced datasets to fill the gaps between the discretized experimental results for all the experimental scenarios without any noticeable overfitting and underfitting. The net power gain obtained by the ANN exhibited a clear peak point for the engine rotation speed of 2000 rpm, which is difficult to obtain using experimental data. © 2021 by the author.

A rectangular venturi nozzle with width and height dimensions of 3 mm and 0.5 mm was used with a vertically downward flow direction. The pressure ratio, which is the ratio of the inlet and outlet pressures, water flow rate, and diverging angle were set as experimental parameters. From the flow visualization, annular and bubbly flows were observed. In the case of bubbly flow, the more bubbles that are generated with a higher water flow rate, the smaller the pressure ratio. In the case of annular flow, the increased pressure ratio and water flow rate induce the breakup of air core in the diverging area and make the interfacial oscillation stronger, which finally causes the flow transition from annular to bubbly flow, by accompanying a sharp increase in the air entrainment rate. During this flow transition, the frictional pressure drop of the two-phase flow is reduced, showing that a two-phase multiplier gets smaller. © 2021 by the authors.

Although HSPs are of great importance, their computational identification remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have two major limitations. First, they relied heavily on amino acid composition features, which inevitably limited their prediction performance. Second, their prediction performance was overestimated because of the independent two-stage evaluations and train-test data redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two novel deep learning algorithms: (1) time-efficient DeepHSP and (2) high-performance DeeperHSP. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DeepHSP that classifies both non-HSPs and six HSP families simultaneously. It outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, despite taking 14–15 times less time for both training and inference. We further improve the performance of DeepHSP by taking advantage of protein transfer learning. While DeepHSP is trained on raw protein sequences, DeeperHSP is trained on top of pre-trained protein representations. Therefore, DeeperHSP remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms increasing F1 scores in both cross-validation and independent test experiments by 20% and 10%, respectively. We envision that the proposed algorithms can provide a proteome-wide prediction of HSPs and help in various downstream analyses for pathology and clinical research. Copyright: © 2021 Min et al.

Although it is possible to implement light distribution through auxiliary devices such as reflectors, it means increasing the weight and size of the luminaire, which reduces the feasibility. Considering the special environment of seaport luminaires, which are installed at a height of 30 m or more, it is necessary to reduce the weight of the device, facilitate replacement, and secure a light source with a long life. In this paper, an optimized lens design was investigated to provide uniform light distribution to meet the requirement in the seaport lighting application. Four types of lens were designed and fabricated to verify the uniform light distribution requirement for the seaport lighting application. Using numerical analysis, we optimized the lens that provides the required minimum overall uniformity for the seaport lighting application. A theoretical analysis for the heatsink structure and shape were conducted to reduce the heat from the high-power LED light sources up to 250 W. As a result of these analyses on the heat dissipation characteristics of the high-power LED light source used in the LED seaport luminaire, the heatsink with hexagonal-shape fins shows the best heat dissipation effect. Finally, a prototype LED seaport luminaire with an optimized lens and heat sink was fabricated and tested in a real seaport environment. The light distribution characteristics of this prototype LED seaport luminaire were compared with a commercial high-pressure sodium luminaire and metal halide luminaire. © 2021 by the authors.

Group 1 had low levels of negative psychological states and high levels of positive psychological states (constituting 35% of the total sample); Group 2 had relatively high level of negative psychological states and very low level of life satisfaction (constituting 13% of the total sample), and Group 3 had moderate level of psychological states (constituting 52% of the total sample). First, it was identified that a group with high level of negative psychological states does not necessarily have a low level of positive psychological states in factors such as their self-esteem, resilience, or life goals. Second, female students were more likely to belong to the group with high manifestations of psychological problems. Students who get higher self-satisfaction from their income than their actual annual income, students with more allowance, students with lower burden relating to their tuition, and students who worked less part-time jobs (falls under the financial factor) were less likely to belong to the group with high manifestations of psychological problems. Students who had numerous communications with their peers and had a sense of trust in their school, and students who felt less alienated were also less likely to belong to the group with high manifestations of psychological problems (falls under the social relationship factor). In addition, students who selected their college major in accordance to their aptitudes and interests, or through the influence of their school teachers, were less likely to belong to the mild risk group or the risk group than the students who decided their college major based on employment prospects or recommendations (falls under the enrollment motivation factor). Meanwhile, students with a higher dependency to their mobile phones had higher probability of belonging to the risk group, and students who had higher computer use frequency, such as using a computer to chat or play games, had a lower probability of belonging to the mild risk group or the risk group (falls under the media utilization factor). The results of the study indicate the need for the following: (1) a three-dimensional diagnosis of the psychological state of college freshmen; (2) measures that can improve social relationships, such as support in the curriculum and linkage to counseling institutions; and (3) the selection of a major in accordance to one’s aptitude, calling for the need for a linkage with career guidance at the high school stage. © 2021 by the authors.

Mecha-nisms connecting railway vehicles must also absorb front and rear shock loads that occur during a train’s operation. To minimize damage, rail car couplers are equipped with a buffer system that absorbs the impact of energy. It is difficult to perform a crash test and evaluate performance by applying a buffer to an actual railway vehicle. In this study, a simulation technique using a mathematical buffer model was introduced to overcome these difficulties. For this, a model of each element of the buffer was built based on the experimental data for each element of the coupling buffer system and a collision simulation program was developed. The buffering characteristics of a 10-car train colliding at 25 km/h were analyzed using a developed simulator. The results of the heavy collision simulation showed that the rubber buffer was directly connected to the hydraulic shock ab-sorber in a solid contact state, and displacement of the hydraulic buffer hardly occurred despite the increase in reaction force due to the high impact speed. Since the impact force is concentrated on the vehicle to which the collision is applied, it may be appropriate to apply a deformation tube with different characteristics depending on the vehicle location. © 2021 by the authors.

The resulting porous dielectric thin films were found to exhibit far stronger resistance to thermo-mechanical instability mechanisms common to conventional SiCOH dielectric thin films without forgoing an ultralow dielectric constant (i.e., ultralow-k). Specifically, the elastic modulus measured by nano-indentation was 13 GPa, which was substantially higher than the value of 6 GPa for a porous low-k film deposited by a conventional method, while dielectric constant exhibited an identical value of 2.1. They also showed excellent resistance against viscoplastic defor-mation, as measured by the ball indentation method, which represented the degree of chemical degradation of the internal bonds. Indentation depth was measured at 5 nm after a 4-h indentation test at 400 °C, which indicated an ~89% decrease compared with conventional SiCOH film. Evolution of film shrinkage and dielectric constant after annealing and plasma exposure were reduced in the low-k film with a self-organized molecular film. Analysis of the film structure via Fourier-trans-form infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated an increase in symmetric linear Si–O–Si molecular chains with terminal –CH3 bonds that were believed to be responsible for both the decrease in dipole moment/dielectric constant and the formation of molecular scaled pores.

The microstructural changes and mechanical properties of Sn-Cu solders regarding Al(Si) addition and the number of reflows were investigated to determine their reliability under high heat and strong vibrations. Using differential scanning calorimetry, the melting points were measured to be approximately 227, 230, and 231 °C for the SC07 solder, SC-0.01Al(Si), and SC-0.03Al(Si), respectively. The cross-sectional analysis results showed that the total intermetallic compounds (IMCs) of the SC-0.03Al(Si) solder grew the least after the as-reflow, as well as after 10 reflows. Electron probe microanalysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the Al-Cu and Cu-Al-Sn IMCs were present inside the solders, and their amounts increased with increasing Al(Si) content. In addition, the Cu6Sn5 IMCs inside the solder became more finely distributed with increasing Al(Si) content. The Sn-0.5Cu-0.03Al(Si) solder exhibited the highest shear strength at the beginning and after 10 reflows, and ductile fracturing was observed in all three solders. This study will facilitate the future application of lead-free solders, such as an Sn-Cu-Al(Si) solder, in automotive electrical components. © 2021 by the authors.

The method is based on convolutional neural networks that learn the global structure information, which corresponds to anatomical structures in medical images. Specifically, the proposed method is designed to learn the global boundary structures via an autoencoder and constrain a segmentation network through a loss function. In this manner, the segmentation model performs the prediction in the learned anatomical feature space. Unlike previous studies that considered anatomical priors by using a pre-trained autoencoder to train segmentation networks, we propose a single-stage approach in which the segmentation network and autoencoder are jointly learned. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the segmentation performance is evaluated in terms of both the overlap and distance metrics on the lung area and spinal cord segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can enhance not only the segmentation performance but also the robustness against domain shifts. © 2021 by the authors.

The representative dyes of DSSCs are ruthenium-complex molecules, which are expensive and require a complicated synthesis process. In this paper, the eco-friendly DSSCs were presented based on water-based electrolytes and a commercially available organic dye. The effect of aging time after the device fabrication and the electrolyte composition on the photovoltaic performance of the eco-friendly DSSCs were investigated. Plasma treatment of TiO2 was adopted to improve the dye adsorption as well as the wettability of the water-based electrolytes on TiO2. It turned out that the plasma treatment was an effective way of improving the photovoltaic performance of the eco-friendly DSSCs by increasing the efficiency by 3.4 times. For more eco-friendly DSSCs, the organic-synthetic dye was replaced by chlorophyll extracted from spinach. With the plasma treatment, the efficiency of the eco-friendly DSSCs based on water-electrolytes and chlorophyll was comparable to those of the previously reported chlorophyll-based DSSCs with non-aqueous electrolytes. © 2021 by the authors.

Although many designers wish to rely on HPB consultants for advice, not all projects can afford consultants. We expect that, in the near future, computer aids such as design expert systems can help designers by providing the role of HPB consultants. The effectiveness and success or failure of the solution offered by the expert system must be affected by the quality, systemic structure, resilience, and applicability of expert knowledge. This study aims to set the problem definition and category required for existing HPB designs, and to find the knowledge acquisition and representation methods that are the most suitable to the design expert system based on the literature review. The HPB design literature from the past 10 years revealed that the greatest features of knowledge acquisition and representation are the increasing proportion of computer-based data analytics using machine learning algorithms, whereas rules, frames, and cognitive maps that are derived from heuristics are conventional representation formalisms of traditional expert systems. Moreover, data analytics are applied to not only literally raw data from observations and measurement, but also discrete processed data as the results of simulations or composite rules in order to derive latent rule, hidden pattern, and trends. Furthermore, there is a clear trend that designers prefer the method that decision support tools propose a solution directly as optimizer does. This is due to the lack of resources and time for designers to execute performance evaluation and analysis of alternatives by themselves, even if they have sufficient experience on the HPB. However, because the risk and responsibility for the final design should be taken by designers solely, they are afraid of convenient black box decision making provided by machines. If the process of using the primary knowledge in which frame to reach the solution and how the solution is derived are trans-parently open to the designers, the solution made by the design expert system will be able to obtain more trust from designers. This transparent decision support process would comply with the re-quirement specified in a recent design study that designers prefer flexible design environments that give more creative control and freedom over design options, when compared to an automated optimization approach. © 2021 by the authors.

This study proposes a thermal metamaterial that provides an efficient thermal cycle with two conflicting objectives: (i) high thermal resistance as a thermal insulator and (ii) high cooling capability as a heat exchanger. To enable these conflicting objectives, we used cellular lattice structures fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM). An efficient design method based on a finite element (FE) mesh was developed to obtain boundary-conformal lattices for arbitrary 3D shapes. FE analyses were then conducted to evaluate the structural and thermal behaviors of the lattice structures. The designed lattice structures were fabricated by powder-bed fusion (PBF) type AM using Ti-6Al-4V powders. Heat conduction tests were then performed to evaluate the thermal resistance of the lattices with various strut diameters, and the resulting thermal resistance increased five to fifteen times in comparison with that of the pure material. Cooling tests were also conducted to evaluate the cooling capability of the lattices, which showed that the lattice structures could act not only as a thermal insulator but also as a heat exchanger. Consequently, the developed lattice structures can be regarded as a thermal metamaterial that is useful in various applications that require a high thermal cycle of heating and cooling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Coolant cooling; Lattice structure; Thermal metamaterial; Thermal resistance","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Cooling; Heat conduction; Heat exchangers; Heat resistance; Metamaterials; Ternary alloys; Thermal cycling; Titanium alloys; Conflicting objectives; Coolant cooling; Cooling capability; High thermal; Lattice structures; Micro architectures; Property; Thermal; Thermal insulators; Thermal metamaterial; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104976013

Among these, layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based nanocomposites are promising materials because of their structural diversity and electronic functionality, which are suitable for photocatalysts, catalytic supports, and charge storage. Here, three Al-based LDHs using different divalent cations (Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+) are synthesized, and their electrical characteristics are investigated in the form of a two-terminal Pt/Al-based LDHs/fluorine-doped tin oxide junction structure. Only the ZnAl-LDH junction exhibits a distinct unipolar switching behavior with an ON–OFF ratio of ≈103 and transmittance of ≈87%; the other junctions (NiAl- and CoAl-LDHs) do not exhibit switching and possess relatively low transparency. This difference is attributed to the relatively vertically stacked ZnAl-LDH layer, which enables the formation of a switching filament through the vertical 2D layer and enhances transparency. The ZnAl-LDH junction has a relatively low trap energy (Et) of ≈0.1 eV that can decrease the SET voltage as the temperature increases, which can be understood by trap-assisted space-charge-limited conduction with thermal-assisted electron excitation.

In the presence of CO2, pyrolysis of SSW showed enhanced CO formation (670 %), comparing with pyrolysis under N2, due to the gas phase reactions (GPRs) between CO2 and volatile hydrocarbons resulted from pyrolysis of SSW. To enhance syngas production from SSW pyrolysis, mesoporous nickel-based catalyst was used for catalytic pyrolysis due to its known catalytic capability for chemical bond scissions of hydrocarbons and biomass-derived oxygenates. The enhanced production of syngas was proportionate to catalytic bed temperature (500, 600, and 700 °C) and catalyst loadings (0.2, 0.5, and 1 g), and the GPRs were independent with H2 formation. All experimental findings indicated that CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis significantly improved H2 and CO formations from a cellulosic biomass waste material, controlling the CO concentration with an introduction of CO2.

For the sinter bonding at 5 MPa, a sufficient shear strength was attained even after an extraordinary short bonding time of 10 s (21.6 MPa). Moreover, the bonding at 2 MPa showed a shear strength of 21.8 MPa after a remarkably short bonding time (20 s), and a near-full density structure was revealed in the bondline after 60 s. The extremely fast sinter-bonding results were attributed to the small particle size and significantly enhanced reducibility of the solvent used.

In the traditional production process, sulfate ion concentration, copper ion concentration and current density are carried out according to the empirical value, which cannot ensure the current efficiency to reach the optimal level. Therefore, firstly, this paper proposes a BP neural network model to improve the current efficiency according to the relationships between sulfate ion concentration, copper ion concentration, current density and the established BP neural network model is trained by using real data from the enterprise. The simulation results indicate that there is a definite error between the predicted current efficiency and corresponding to the current efficiency measured at the production site. It is proposed that the BP neural network improved by the improved PSO to further improve the prediction accuracy of the BP neural network. Simulation results indicate that the prediction error of the current efficiency is greatly reduced that meets the accuracy requirements. On the premise of guaranteeing the quality of copper electrowinning, the current density, sulfate ion concentration and copper ion concentration corresponding to the maximum current efficiency accurately predicted by this method can be respectively adjusted in real-time in the copper electrowinning process, which realizes the optimization of current efficiency in the process of copper electrowinning under the background of low carbon and environmental protection. © 2021, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","BP neural network; Copper electrowinning; Improved PSO; Low carbon; Maximum current efficiency","Backpropagation; Concentration (process); Copper; Copper metallurgy; Current density; Efficiency; Electrowinning; Metal ions; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sulfur compounds; BP neural network model; BP neural networks; Copper electrowinning; Current efficiency; Prediction accuracy; Prediction errors; Production process; Research objectives; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101032144

Recent research has explored the importance of student engagement when learning with video in online and blended courses. However, little is known about students' goals and intents when engaging with video. Furthermore, there is limited empirical evidence on the impact of learning context on engagement with video, which limits our understanding of how students learn from video. To address this gap, we identify a set of engagement goals for learning with video, and study associated student activity in relation to learning context (course week, exam, and rewatch). In Study 1, we conducted a survey (n = 116) that maps students' video viewing activities to their engagement goals and intents. We identified a variety of engagement goals, specifically Reflect, Flag, Remember, Clarify, Skim, Search, Orient, and Take a break. In Study 2, we analyzed clickstream data generated by 387 students enrolled in three semester-long courses. We examined the impact of learning context on students’ engagement with video. A multilevel model showed different patterns for online and blended courses. Students in the online course showed much more strategic and adaptive use of video. As the semester progressed, students in the online courses performed fewer Reflect and Search. During exam weeks and when rewatching videos, online students performed more Search within the video. The only trend that was found for blended learning students was an increase in Skim with course week. These findings have implications for video players that adapt to context, such as helping students easily locate important in-video information during the exam week or when rewatching previously watched videos. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Engagement; Learning analytics; Learning context; Online/blended courses; Video-based learning","Education computing; Regression analysis; Students; Blended learning; Clickstream data; Higher education; Learning context; Multilevel model; Recent researches; Student engagement; Video information; E-learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100397181

However, these hydrogels should not elicit any immunological response and synthesis steps should be easier and tunable according to the requirements. Considering these properties, we synthesized a thermo-sensitive triblock copolymer consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein capable of leveraging the needs for a proper wound closure and tissue regeneration on excisional injuries. Firstly, the triblock copolymer consisting of poly(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide (PCLA) was synthesized and then the copolymer was grafted with BSA to yield BSA-PCLA bioconjugates. Aqueous solutions of free-flowing bioconjugate sol at room temperature can transform to gel at physiological temperature with high viscoelastic properties. Subcutaneous injection of BSA-PCLA bioconjugate sol into the back of Sprague-Dawley rats formed gel immediately and found to be bioresorbable after 5 weeks without significant toxicity at implantation sites. BSA-PCLA bioconjugate gel exhibited good adhesive property to major organs including liver, heart, and spleen when compared with control PCLA gel. When tested for in vivo wound closure trials, the BSA-PCLA gels showed rapid wound contraction compared to the PCLA and the control. The increased angiogenesis and collagen deposition were confirmed from the histological studies of the samples. These highly adhesive, biocompatible, biodegradable, thermos-sensitive bioconjugate gels show promising potential in wound healing and tissue regeneration without any additional biofactors or inorganic nanoparticles. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","Biodegradable copolymers; Cutaneous wound; Injectable hydrogels; Thermo-responsive; Tissue regeneration","Adhesives; Biocompatibility; Biosynthesis; Block copolymers; Gels; Hydrogels; Mammals; Nanoparticles; Polyethylene glycols; Sols; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; Viscoelasticity; Bovine serum albumin proteins (BSA); Bovine serum albumins; Immunological response; Injectable hydrogels; Inorganic nanoparticle; Physiological temperature; Thermo-responsive copolymers; Viscoelastic properties; Biomolecules",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100689454

An earlier and accurate diagnosis of the brain tumor is of foremost important to avoid future complications. Precise segmentation of brain tumors provides a basis for surgical planning and treatment to doctors. Manual detection using MRI images is computationally complex in cases where the survival of the patient is dependent on timely treatment, and the performance relies on domain expertise. Therefore, computerized detection of tumors is still a challenging task due to significant variations in their location and structure, i.e., irregular shapes and ambiguous boundaries. In this study, we propose a custom Mask Region-based Convolution neural network (Mask RCNN) with a densenet-41 backbone architecture that is trained via transfer learning for precise classification and segmentation of brain tumors. Our method is evaluated on two different benchmark datasets using various quantitative measures. Comparative results show that the custom Mask-RCNN can more precisely detect tumor locations using bounding boxes and return segmentation masks to provide exact tumor regions. Our proposed model achieved an accuracy of 96.3% and 98.34% for segmentation and classification respectively, demonstrating enhanced robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

On the other hand, an essential development of blue-emitting devices rather than other color emitters has been hindered by their defect tolerance and quantum efficiency which are relatively lower than those of green-emitting NCs. Moreover, few studies have examined the synthesis and properties of blue-emitting MHP NCs or their applications to light-emitting diodes (LEDs). To solve these problems, this paper reports a facile and controllable way of producing emission wavelength tunable CsPb(Br1−xClx)3NCs using a fast and straightforward chemical treatment with the trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSC) additive. Structural and chemical analysis showed that the Cl content in the CsPb(Br1−xClx)3NCs could be modulated by TMSC addition without changing the morphologies. The photoluminescence emission peak wavelength of the CsPb(Br1−xClx)3NCs could be modulated from 515 to 416 nm by increasing the TMSC content. To this end, blue and green LEDs were successfully demonstrated by using the TMSC-treated CsPb(Br1−xClx)3NCs as an emissive layer, showing a controllable emission wavelength from 473 to 511 nm. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Chemical analysis; Chlorine compounds; Efficiency; Light; Perovskite; Blue emitting devices; Blue light emitting diodes; Emission wavelength; Full-color displays; Inorganic materials; Luminescence efficiencies; Photoluminescence emission; Trimethylsilyl chloride; Light emitting diodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104094698

By evolving the states of the SCP, linearly coupled to a reference state, we show that, below a dynamical transition temperature (Td), the SCP is trapped in a metastable state leading to slow dynamics. At a lower temperature, TK≠0, the configurational entropy vanishes, resulting in a thermodynamic random first order ideal glass transition. The relaxation time obeys the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman law, diverging at T=T0≈TK.

Based on these characteristics, PCM can be used in larger expanded memory or faster storage compared to HDD or NAND flash memory. Therefore, various companies are trying to deploy PCM-based memory products. However, studies on deciding the target system of PCM are still insufficient, which is an obstacle to the commercialization of PCM. In this paper, a file system benchmark, Filebench, is evaluated with various operating options to find the most appropriate workload for PCM as storage. An experiment was conducted in a virtual system by mounting PCM with a PCM-aware file system. The results demonstrate that the PCM-based system performs up to 500 times better than traditional storage if executing workloads with a significant amount of write operations and synchronization operations.

By adjusting the switching frequency in the above region during the PWM control process, the circulating current period can be eliminated and the turn-on period of the bidirectional switch of the dual-bridge LLC (DBLLC) resonant converter is reduced compared to that with a conventional PWM control scheme with a fixed switching frequency, resulting in better switching and conduction loss.

As a result, the young-stage aronia leaves contained more abundant flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and polyphenols with higher antioxidant activity than those in the old-stage leaves. Overall, our findings indicate that aronia leaves contain potential bioactive compounds that could be used to develop functional food ingredients. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology","Antioxidant activity; Aronia leaf; Flavonoid; Harvest maturity; Polyphenol",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105946965

Based on the results of the analysis, a study was conducted on the necessity of estimating the appropriate design volume according to the characteristics of the permeable pavement. Therefore, this study analyses EMC and summation of loads (SOL) reduction efficiencies based on the monitoring results pertaining to 3 y. Analysis of pollutant removal efficiency and runoff reduction efficiency of filter-type permeable and crevice-type permeable pavements showed that biochemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, and total suspended solid values increased from 2016 to 2018 for crevice-type permeable pavement. On the other hand, the filter-type permeable pavement was found to reduce the efficiency. In the case of crevice-type permeable pavement, the proper design was based on the storage, and the reduction efficiency increased due to this, while the filter-type permeable pavement is a facility that treats non-point pollutants by continual filtering. Therefore, it should be designed as water quality flow (WQF ), instead of erroneously designing it as water quality volume (WQV ). The obtained results are considered to be an important derivation factor when calculating the design capacity according to the type and characteristics of low impact development (LID) facilities. © 2021 Desalination Publications.

However, problems occur when installing LID facilities due to the incomplete and incomprehensive analysis of their design capacity adequacy. In this study, the removal efficiency and design volume adequacy of LID facilities were analyzed based on rainfall monitoring data in four LID facilities (grassed swale, vegetative filter strip, bio-retention, and permeable pavement). The group of LID facilities designed on WQV showed a higher flow (37%) and pollutant (total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) removal efficiencies (20%~37%) than the group of LID facilities designed on WQF. A surface area/catchment area (SA/CA) graph was developed for the evaluation of design volume adequacy based on rainfall monitoring data. The graph’s coefficient of determination showed over 0.5 in all parameters. In particular, flow and TP were more than 0.95. The SA/CA and L/CA graph considered the difference of structure mechanisms in LID facilities and confirmed an improved coefficient of determination in flow, TSS, and TP compared to the SA/CA graph. These results confirm the feasibility of applying a SA/CA and L/CA graph for the evaluation of design volume adequacy in LID facilities.

Fine-grained W powders were synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis using an ammonium metatungstate hydrate solution and hydrogen reduction. The XRD analysis of the powder, pyrolyzed below 600 oC, showed tungsten oxide hydrate and WO3 peaks, while the powder pyrolyzed at 700 oC was composed of only the WO3 phase. As the precursor concentration increased, the particle size of the WO3 powder increased, which was interpreted to be due to an increase in the amount of solute in the droplet. The hydrogen-reduced powder showed a spherical shape with fine pores inside. XRD and XPS analysis revealed that the WO3 powder was completely reduced to metallic W by hydrogen reduction, and some oxide layers existed on the powder surface. The consolidated specimen prepared by spark plasma sintering of hydrogen-reduced W powder exhibited a relative density of 94.1% and a Vickers hardness value of 3.89 GPa. The relative density and hardness of the specimens prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis showed relatively lower values than when commercial W powder, with an average particle size of 1.22 µm, was sintered under the same conditions. These results were explained by the formation of agglomerates in the W powder prepared by the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method.

The irregular embossing of the metal surface was completed by nickel plating using micro particles of artificial diamond and aluminum oxide. Particles of various sizes were used, and the plating height was set at 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 of the particle size. When the embossed surface was implemented on the metal surface through the particles, an undercut area was formed on the metal surface. During insert molding, the resin solidified in the undercut area, which increased the adhesive force. As the undercut size was different depending on the plating height and particle size, the adhesive strength varied, and as the particle size increased, the adhesive strength increased. The adhesion strength was higher in the plated specimens using aluminum oxide particles than those with artificial diamond particles. Moreover, the adhesive strength was better with ABS resin containing glass fiber than with pure ABS resin.

An AC motor and an inverter were used to rotate the camshaft in the engine cylinder head. A single plunger high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP) driven by a square cam at the end of the camshaft was used in the gasoline direct injection engine. The rotation position of the square cam was measured by a rotary encoder. The developed system allows control of the camshaft rotation speed, the HPFP pressure control valve (PCV) opening and closing timing, and the fuel injection duration, which are three important factors affecting the fuel rail pressure (FRP). It is confirmed that the fuel rail pressure can be made to vary wit different combinations of these three factors. By using the experimental system developed in this study, the fuel rail pressure can be effectively controlled in the range of 3 MPa to 20 MPa.

In this study the effect of ducting on the aerodynamic performance of electric vehicle is given due attention as a new approach to improve aerodynamic energy efficiency. Intensive numerical calculation is made using simple body. Three-dimensional, incompressible, and steady governing equations were solved by PHOENICS version 2018 (a commercial CFD software) with extended turbulent model proposed by Chen-Kim (1987). In this numerical study, ducted and slightly modified Ahmed model is used to study aerodynamic characteristics of ducted model and how ducting would contribute to the energy consumption reduction effort from aerodynamic resistance. A significant decrease in a total drag with duct size is investigated. About 14.3 % drag reduction is observed on one of the test models used as an illustration.

For a KTX (Korean high-speed train) unit, the wheel unloading ratios, which are the criteria for evaluating derailments in UIC (International union of railways) and TSI (Technical Specification for Interoperability) regulations, were calculated through the formula under the driving regulations according to cross-wind speeds, and the theoretical results were compared and evaluated through a multibody dynamics (MBD) simulation. In addition, the wheel unloading ratios were calculated for various frequencies of cross-winds. As a result of the formula and MBD, the wheel unloading ratios were shown to increase rapidly regardless of the dampers in sus-pension when the cross-wind frequency and the natural frequency of a vehicle were in agreement. Finally, we calculated the changes of wheel unloading ratio for different track gauges and found that these theoretical equations could calculate more accurate results than the existing Kunieda’s formula. The formula derived in this study has the advantage of considering various variables, such as fluctuant cross-winds, rail irregularities, and derailment behaviors, which were not considered in previous studies or Kunieda’s formula.

Various damage criteria are employed to explain fracture and failure in the nose part of a cold shell. In this study, differences in microstructure among fractured materials and analysis of their surfaces indicated the occurrence of brittle fractures. The degree of “plastic deformation-induced embrittlement” (PDIE) of plastically deformable materials affects the likelihood of brittle fractures; PDIE can also decrease the strength in tension due to the Bauschinger effect. Two indicators of brittle fracture are presented, i.e., the critical value of PDIE and the allowable tensile strength (which in turn depends on the degree of PDIE or embrittlement-effective strain). When the maximum principal stress is greater than the latter and the PDIE is greater than the former, our method determines the likelihood of brittle fracture.

This study aimed to evaluate the regulatory effects of fermented rice germ extracts on hepatic glucose metabolism in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Rice germ was fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum and extracted with 30% ethanol (RG_30E) or 50% ethanol (RG_50E). Mice were fed modified AIN-93 diets containing fermented rice germ extracts and ferulic acid for 8 weeks. RG_50E significantly reduced food intake as well as liver weight and RG_30E and RG_50E improved glucose homeostasis, as indicated by fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance. Hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were significantly decreased in db/db mice fed RG_30E and RG_50E. The antioxidant capacity of RG_30E and RG_50E was confirmed by a decrease in malondialdehyde levels and an increase in hepatic superoxide dismutase activity. The expression of genes related to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis was significantly regulated by RG_30E and RG_50E.

A high-Al alloying layer was successfully fabricated on rolled AZ31B plate surface through multipass RFSP reacting the additive pure Al powder (3 μm diameter) along its groove line. During RFSP, the Al powder was completely dissolved into the α-Mg matrix and reacted in situ with the α-Mg matrix to produce Mg17Al12 precipitates. With the strengthening effects by the solid solution of supersaturated Al and in situ Mg17Al12 precipitates, RFSP improved the hardness, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength of the as-received AZ31B by 58%, 34%, and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, aging treatment was conducted after RFSP, inducing a lamellar-shaped Mg17Al12 in the RFSPed layer. The additional strengthening effect by the aging-induced Mg17Al12 resulted in further improvement in the hardness (15%, 97 Hv) and yield strength (13%, 102 MPa) compared to the RFSPed layer. However, the ultimate tensile strength deteriorated due to the too high fraction of aging-induced Mg17Al12 precipitates that caused a premature fracture. The results of the hydrogen evolution measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that RFSP and subsequent aging treatment enhanced the corrosion resistance due to the corrosion barrier effect of the in situ and aging-induced Mg17Al12. © 2021","Aging treatment; In situ reaction; Magnesium alloy; Reactive friction stir processing","Alloying; Alloying elements; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Binary alloys; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Fabrication; Friction; Friction stir welding; Hardness; Tensile strength; Yield stress; Ageing treatments; Al powder; Alloying layer; AZ31B magnesium alloys; Friction stir processing; In-situ reactions; Mg matrix; Reactive friction stir processing; Strengthening effect; Ultimate tensile strength; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102793087

The proposed DUESA architecture dynamically allocates antennas to sub-arrays based on channel state information, which leads to a combinatorial problem to optimize the sum rate. The exact solution to this problem requires an exhaustive search; however, the total number of candidates to search through can be extremely large in massive MIMO systems. To address this challenge, we propose three sub-optimal algorithms. The first is a tabu search-based algorithm, which examines the neighbors of the current solution to antenna-to-sub-array allocation and moves to the best one in each iteration. The second is a sequential antenna-reallocation algorithm with reduced complexity, which updates an antenna-to-sub-array assignment in each iteration. The third algorithm, that is, greedy antenna allocation, is composed of two sub-optimal algorithms. In its first part, only a single antenna is allocated to each sub-array based on a conventional algorithm. Then, in the second part, the antennas are added sequentially to each sub-array to optimize the system sum rate. The numerical results demonstrate that the DUESA architecture achieves substantially higher total achievable rates than conventional PC-HBF schemes. Furthermore, it has approximately 10%-20% higher energy efficiency than the conventional UESA architecture. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","dynamic unequal sub-array (DUESA); Hybrid beamforming; massive MIMO; partially connected hybrid beamforming (PC-HBF); power consumption; tabu search (TS); unequal sub-array (UESA)","Beamforming; Channel state information; Computational complexity; Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Memory architecture; MIMO systems; Tabu search; Antenna allocation; Combinatorial problem; Conventional algorithms; Hybrid beamforming; Massive multiple-input- multiple-output system (MIMO); Reduced complexity; Search-based algorithms; Sub-optimal algorithms; Beam forming networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102622676

Herein, the effects of the DP and CP produced by an aging-treatment on the corrosion resistance of the AZ91D Mg alloy were systemically investigated in the same corrosion test condition (i.e. 3.5 wt% NaCl). The morphologies of the DP and CP were controlled by changing the aging-treatment conditions. The area fraction of the DP, the number of CPs per unit area, and the average length of the CPs were quantified as microstructural factors. A quantitative correlation analysis between the corrosion rate and the quantified microstructural factors revealed that the corrosion resistance of the aging-treated AZ91D Mg alloy depended on the DP and CP connectivities. DP with low connectivity accelerated the corrosion by acting as a galvanic source, while DP with high connectivity along the grain boundary functioned as a corrosion barrier, resulting in a reduced corrosion rate.

Two alternative austenitization treatments at 850 °C (LA) or 1100 °C (HA) for 10 min were conducted on cold-rolled steels to achieve different sizes of prior γ grains before intercritical annealing (IA) (600–660 °C for 1 h). The samples, which were annealed at the same temperature, showed two-phase nanolaminate microstructures of tempered martensite (α'temp) and retained austenite (γR) with similar phase fraction regardless of the austenitization temperature. When annealed at the same temperature, the LA specimen showed smaller colonies of γR grains with the same crystallographic orientation and spatial alignment as compared to the HA specimen. The LA specimen revealed higher strength, ductility, and toughness than the HA specimen. The main reason for this mechanical response is related to microstrain localization during deformation. Due to the appearance of colonies of γR with the same crystallographic orientation and spatial alignment, the microstrain tends to be localized in colonies with favorable orientation and alignment to the tensile axis apart from strain partitioning to the γR. The LA specimen with smaller colonies of γR exhibits a more homogeneous microstrain distribution relative to the HA specimen. This results in more global TRIP and TWIP behaviors during plastic deformation of LA specimen, leading to the improved mechanical responses. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Medium-Mn steel; Strain partitioning; Tensile behavior; Transformation-induced plasticity; Twinning-induced plasticity","Alignment; Aluminum coated steel; Annealing; Austenite; Cold rolled steel; Cold rolling; Image enhancement; Manganese metallography; Manganese steel; Metal cladding; Steel sheet; Transformation Induced Plasticity steel; Austenitization temperatures; Crystallographic orientations; Digital image correlations; Intercritical annealing; Strain partitioning; Tempered martensite; Transformation induced plasticity; Twinning-induced plasticities; Plasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101645583

As a major feature, a gait training algorithm with high responsiveness and flexibility was achieved by analyzing the inverse dynamics of the five-link mechanism with a foothold attached to the end of the mechanism and compensating for the required torque for the link motion and the patient’s weight during gait training. To this end, inverse dynamics was solved using Newton Euler’s method, and three training modes were proposed. First, passive mode training performs three tasks: motion compensation of the five-link mechanism for the given constant walking speed through the inverse dynamics, patient’s weight compensation, and tracking of the gait trajectory of the foothold using PD control to practice the normal walking pattern and restore muscle strength for standing. Second, Active-assisted mode training was implemented for the patient to receive muscle assistance from an electric motor in proportion to the patient’s walking intention in addition to the reduced compensations of the motion of the five-link mechanism and patient’s weight. Third, active mode training was implemented so that the patient can perform gait training while feeling their own weight with the time-varying motion compensation of the five-link mechanism. Finally, the performance of each gait training mode was experimentally verified, and the muscle activity was measured using EMG sensors to compare the muscle assistance performances of the training modes. Furthermore, the correction of the gait motion of the affected leg according to the motor assistance in active-assisted mode was also verified. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Inverse dynamics; Power assist; Walking rehabilitation","Agricultural robots; Dynamics; End effectors; Inverse problems; Motion compensation; Motion tracking; Muscle; Walking aids; Active-assisted; Inverse dynamics; Link mechanisms; Muscle activities; Muscle strength; Normal walking; Rehabilitation robot; Walking intentions; Educational robots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101643659

Usually an assigned employee records manually the temperatures of the hospital cold storages such as refrigerators and freezers that keep them at regular intervals. In this research, a low power wireless Bluetooth Low Energy network is applied where the central monitoring personal computer, receives the temperature data and stores in a database. The system consists of many beacons which are wirelessly sending the measured temperature data, and the central monitoring computer which allows the user to monitor that data. In the case of wireless signals getting blocked due to obstacles, repeaters called bridges send the data to the central computer forming a so-called scatter net. Once the data is received by the Bluetooth module connected to the monitoring computer, an application saves the data into a database. This web application forms a website where the users holding the authentication information can log in and monitor the temperature data in the form of tables and graphs. The same information can be viewed by a smartphone and a person in charge receives a warning SMS message. This system also provides a scheduled backup system where the database is automatically backed up periodically. The suggested system has the advantage of managing reagent records with reduced manpower whilst coping for emergency situations automatically. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Bio-specimens; Bluetooth low energy; Database; Hospital cold storage; Sensor network; Temperature","Article; controlled study; cryopreservation; human; temperature measurement; text messaging; wireless communication; workforce; biobank; devices; hospital management; information processing; temperature; wireless communication; Biological Specimen Banks; Data Management; Humans; Materials Management, Hospital; Temperature; Wireless Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101525148

However, LiDAR sensors have relatively low resolutions, take considerable time to acquire laser range measurements, and require significant resources to process and store large-scale point clouds. To tackle these issues, many depth image sampling algorithms have been proposed, but their performances are unsatisfactory in complex on-road environments, especially when the sampling rate of measuring equipment is relatively low. Although region-of-interest (ROI)-based sampling has achieved some promising results for LiDAR sampling in on-road environments, the rate of ROI sampling has not been thoroughly investigated, which has limited reconstruction performance. To address this problem, this article proposes a solution to the budget distribution optimization problem to find optimal sampling rates according to the characteristics of each region. A simple yet effective mean absolute error (MAE)-aware model of reconstruction errors was developed and employed to analytically derive optimal sampling rates. In addition, a practical LiDAR sampling framework for autonomous driving was developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all previous approaches in terms of both the object and overall scene reconstruction performances. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Autonomous driving; LiDAR sampling; on-road environment; ROI-based sampling","Autonomous vehicles; Budget control; Image segmentation; Partial discharges; Roads and streets; Laser range measurements; Light detection and ranging; Mean absolute error; Measuring equipments; Optimal sampling rates; Reconstruction error; Scene reconstruction; Spatiotemporal information; Optical radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100865472

Compared with 5-nm-thick ZnO, 20-nm-thick ZnO exhibited a better rectifying nature. The average barrier height and ideality factor at room temperature were extracted to be 0.64 eV and 2.33 eV, and 1.01 eV and 1.16 eV, for 5-nm- and 20-nm-thick ZnO, respectively. These results indicate that both the barrier height and ideality factor were altered effectively by changing the ZnO thickness. The temperature-dependent reverse current–voltage (I–V) characteristics revealed that tunneling was dominant for the 5-nm-thick ZnO. A laterally inhomogeneous barrier was appropriate to explain the forward I–V characteristics for both samples. Based on the parallel conductance method and forward I–V data, a lower interface state density was observed for 20-nm-thick ZnO, implying improved interface quality. These results suggest that the electrical properties of n-GaN Schottky contacts could be easily modulated by changing the ZnO thickness. © 2021, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","barrier height; GaN; interface state density; ZnO thickness","Gallium nitride; II-VI semiconductors; III-V semiconductors; Interface states; Metallic films; Oxide minerals; Single crystals; Ultrathin films; Zinc oxide; Ideality factors; Interface quality; Interface state density; Parallel conductance; Reverse currents; Schottky contacts; Single crystal substrates; Temperature dependent; Atomic layer deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099918947

Depending on the sintering time, the SnSe samples show the conversion of p-type conduction with the Seebeck coefficient value of +503 μV/K to n-type conduction with the Seebeck coefficient value of −1500 μV/K. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy to reveal that the transition of the Seebeck properties is due to the imbalanced composition of SnSe caused by impurities (SnSe2, SnSe1-x) formed during pressureless sintering.

The retraction dynamics of a liquid droplet after impact on a solid surface is less explored than its counterpart, the spreading dynamics, even though it is equally crucial for determining the performance in actual applications. Therefore, in this study, the effects of groove orientation, impact velocity, and surface temperature on the retraction dynamics of a water droplet were investigated through high-speed imaging. The impact velocity and surface temperature were systematically changed while keeping the size of the grooved structures the same. As the impact velocity of the droplet was increased, the enhanced spreading along the groove structures delayed the initiation of droplet retraction. This resulted in anisotropic shapes of the droplet during retraction. During the early stage of droplet retraction, the retraction rate of the droplet was found to be independent of both the groove orientation and impact velocity. The anisotropic retraction of the droplet was also observed by increasing the surface temperature. At a high surface temperature (250°C), there was significant reduction in the retraction rate (~20%) in the direction perpendicular to the grooves, resulting in the formation of an ellipsoidal droplet. It is proposed that the oscillating vapour flow underneath the droplet caused by the groove structures is responsible for the temperature-induced anisotropic retraction. © 2020","Droplet impact; Heated surface; Hydrophobic surface; Microgrooved surface; Retraction dynamics","Anisotropy; Atmospheric temperature; Hydrophobicity; Oscillating flow; Surface properties; Velocity; Wetting; Anisotropic shapes; Anisotropic wetting; Grooved structures; High speed imaging; Hydrophobic surfaces; Spreading dynamics; Surface temperatures; Temperature-induced; Drops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098670917

Adaptively refined TH meshes are created by cutting octree background meshes with the boundary of an analysis domain. A multithreshold criterion for mesh refinement is proposed to accurately capture the evolution of the damage phase field. Shape functions for transition TH elements are developed to satisfy the compatibility across the interelement boundaries between TH elements with different refinement levels.

Therefore, to improve cycling performance, considerable attention has been paid to the development of an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Catalysts that can more effectively reduce the overpotential and improve the cycling performance for the OER during charging are of particular interest. In this study, porous carbon derived from protein-based tofu was investigated as a catalyst support for the oxygen electrode (O2-electrode) of Li-O2batteries, wherein ORR and OER occur. The porous carbon was synthesized using carbonization and KOH activation, and RuO2and Pt electrocatalysts were introduced to improve the electrical conductivity and catalytic performance. The well-dispersed Pt/RuO2electrocatalysts on the porous N-doped carbon support (Pt/RuO2@ACT) showed excellent ORR and OER catalytic activity. When incorporated into a Li-O2battery, the Pt/RuO2@ACT O2-electrode exhibited a high specific discharge capacity (5724.1 mA h g−1at 100 mA g−1), a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.64 V at 2000 mA h g−1), and excellent cycling stability (43 cycles with a limit capacity of 1000 mA h g−1).

NCL utilizes a well-cleaved mold edge with microtrench patterns to slide continuously over a UV-curable liquid resin-coated substrate under conformal contact, where the resin and substrate can be chosen for suitable waveguide core and undercladding materials. The local heating of a trench mold can control the viscosity of liquid resin for optimal filling into the microchannels followed by smooth extrusion, which is subsequently UV-cured. Such a smoothly extruded resin core exhibits a very smooth surface potentially promising for the low-loss waveguiding operation which was experimentally confirmed by optical insertion loss characterization. The proposed technique may provide a practical route to the continuous and seamless fabrication of scalable waveguides and photonic elements. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","Nanochannel-guided lithography; One-step continuous patterning; Polymer waveguide; Ridge waveguide; Smooth sidewall surface","Curing; Extrusion; Fabrication; Molds; Polymers; Resins; Substrates; Coated substrates; Conformal contacts; Continuous extrusion; Flexible polymers; Optical insertion loss; Photonic elements; Polymer substrate; UV curable liquids; Ridge waveguides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100217322

To enrich SRB in the sulfidogenic stage, batch tests were performed with various granular sludge pretreatments. Starvation was the most effective pretreatment, increasing SO42− removal and minimizing chemical oxygen demand (COD) loss by inhibiting methanogen activity. Microbial community analysis showed that Desulfovibrio, Desulfotomaculum, and Syntrophobacter were the dominant SRB in the sulfidogenic stage (5.0%, 3.1%, and 2.4%, respectively). This enabled SO42− reduction (86%) and volatile fatty acid production (55% of fed COD) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 h. Conversely, biogas with a reduced H2S content (110 ppmv) was produced in the methanogenic stage (HRT = 6 h). A granular sludge comparison revealed differences in their ecology, structure, and extracellular polymeric substance characteristics. Economic feasibility analysis demonstrated that TSADS can lead to a cost reduction of $80–90/1,000 m3 CH4 compared to single-stage anaerobic digestion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Granular sludge; Hydrogen sulfide; Starvation; Sulfate-reducing bacteria; Two-stage anaerobic digestion system","Biogas; Chemical oxygen demand; Cost reduction; Digestive system; Granular materials; Hydrogen sulfide; Methanogens; Organic carbon; Sulfur compounds; Volatile fatty acids; Biogas production; Economic feasibility analysis; Extra-cellular polymeric substances; Fatty acid productions; Hydraulic retention time; Microbial community analysis; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Two-stage anaerobic digestions; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096833018

However, conventional tactile sensor arrays suffer from electrical crosstalk caused by current leakages between the tactile cells. The approaches that have been proposed thus far to overcome this issue require complex rectifier circuits or a serial fabrication process. This article reports a flexible tactile sensor array fabricated through a batch process using a mesh. A carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane composite is used to form an array of sensing cells in the mesh through a simple ""dip-coating""process and is cured into a concave shape. The contact area between the electrode and the composite changes significantly under pressure, resulting in an excellent sensitivity (5.61 kPa-1) over a wide range of pressure up to 600 kPa. The mesh separates the composite into the arranged sensing cells to prevent the electrical connection between adjacent cells and simultaneously connects each cell mechanically. Additionally, the sensor shows superior durability compared with previously reported tactile sensors because the mesh acts as a support beam. Furthermore, the tactile sensor array is successfully utilized as a Braille reader via information processing based on machine learning. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Braille reading; crosstalk-free; high durability; mesh; tactile sensors","Batch data processing; Carbon nanotubes; Electric connectors; Electric rectifiers; Human robot interaction; Mesh generation; Silicones; Diverse applications; Electrical connection; Electrical crosstalks; Fabrication process; Flexible tactile sensors; Human Machine Interface; Rectifier circuit; Tactile sensor array; Crosstalk; baysilon; carbon nanotube; dimeticone; chemistry; electronic device; equipment design; genetic procedures; human; pressure; touch; Biosensing Techniques; Dimethylpolysiloxanes; Equipment Design; Humans; Nanotubes, Carbon; Pressure; Touch; Wearable Electronic Devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103228922

Customized thermoelectric modules were placed between the exhaust gas channel and two coolant channels for waste heat recovery. A diesel engine releases the exhaust gas flow into the exhaust gas channel of the TEG placed in the middle of the tail pipe. Experimental results showed that a TEG design in which a flow straightener is positioned near the inlet of the TEG needs to be avoided because of a low power output to pressure loss ratio. The net power output, energy conversion efficiency, and pressure drop characteristics were enhanced as the location of flow straightener moved rearward of the TEG.

This work was designated to synthesize superparamagnetic mesoporous hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanorods (NRs) with the intrinsic pure phase through the doping of cobalt ions inside it. This nanoparticle was synthesized using a black Scallop seashell as a low cost calcium source using oxalic acid as a strong chelating agent via microwave synthesis. The prepared magnetic HAp NRs are analyzed by diverse methods to understand the clarity of phase and its nanostructural features. XRD and EDX results prove that Co is distributed well in the HAp nanoparticles without affecting its structure. The BET surface areas of CoHAp-1, CoHAp-2, and pristine HAp NRs were found to be 69, 126, and 97 m2 g−1, correspondingly. Further, evaluated pore volume of CoHAp-1, CoHAp-2, and pristine HAp NRs are identified to be 0.0275, 0.0349, and 0.0368 cm3 g−1 and also pore diameters were found as 3.02, 4.67, and 4.71 nm. Hence, the HAp mesoporous NRs with higher surface area were achieved with the incorporation of Co in the HAp system. The superparamagnetic characteristics were identified only in the Co-doped HAp samples. The high saturation magnetization of 0.20 Am2 kg−1 was observed with the high doping of Co ions. Toxicity of the pristine and the Co-incorporated HAp samples were evaluated using zebrafish. The toxicity result reveals that Co incorporations in HAp do not affect significantly the biocompatible nature compared to the pristine HAp sample. Antibacterial test shows excellent antibacterial activities for Co-HAp samples among different pathogens. Hence, the approach of oxalic acid-associated microwave mediated synthesis of intrinsic mesoporous superparamagnetic HAp NRs from naturally occurring seashells as a precursor can be a superior method for obtaining nanomaterials towards various applications like magnetic resonance imaging, targeting of drug, hyperthermia, and cancer treatments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","A; B; D.

This study proposes the slippery nature of the LIS can be assessed by dynamic contact angles of the working fluid on the LIS and its scaling model. Experiments: We measured the apparent dynamic advancing and receding contact angles on a LIS using a modified Wilhelmy plate technique for the first time. Lubricant having different viscosities was infused into the sanded polytetrafluoroethylene surface to fabricate the LIS. The surface was immersed into or withdrawn from an aqueous glycerol-water solution by varying the capillary number and the lubricant viscosity. Findings: The dynamic contact angles on LIS was found to be sensitive to changes in both the lubricant viscosity and the capillary number. The cube of the dynamic contact angles on the LIS was proportional to θD3~Ca1, which follows a conventional hydrodynamic theory. In addition, the decreasing lubricant viscosity shifted the cube of the dynamic contact angles to high capillary numbers.

The nickel silicate shell induces the preservation of stability and hydrophilicity and increase in ionic conductivity, while porosity and pore size of SB-PE-Ni-x are reduced from 67.4% and 0.819 µm (SB-PE) to 57.9% and 0.557 µm (SB-PE-Ni-100). Chemical characterizations show that when nickel is coated onto SB-PE, porous structure and chemical bonding of SB-PE-Ni-x remain unchanged with high water uptake (32.5%) even after alkali treatment. This is evidence of high ionic conductivity. The performances of aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) using mixed naphthoquinone and potassium ferrocyanide dissolved in potassium hydroxide are then investigated with SB-PE and SB-PE-Ni-x membranes. As a result, AORFB using SB-PE-Ni-50 shows high energy efficiency (80%) and low capacity loss rate (0.0235 Ah∙L−1 per cycle). This is because SB-PE-Ni-50 has optimal pore size showing less cross-over of active materials and high ionic conductivity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aqueous organic redox flow batteries; Ferrocyanide; Naphthoquinone; Nickel silicate shell; Porous polyethylene membrane","Aliphatic compounds; Alkalinity; Chemical bonds; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Hydrophilicity; Ionic conductivity; Ketones; Nickel coatings; Polyethylenes; Pore size; Potassium hydroxide; Silicates; Chemical characterization; High energy efficiency; Hydrophilic nickels; Hydrothermal methods; Polyethylene membrane; Porosity and pore size; Porous structures; Potassium ferrocyanide; Nickel compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093690174

The synthesized ZnO NRs was confirmed by various characterization methods like X-ray diffraction, FTIR, SEM-EDX, UV–vis, TEM and Raman spectra analysis. The obtained nanorods show less particle size with a distinctive high surface area. The photodegradation activity of obtained ZnO NRs shows 81.3 % of dye degradation at high concentration whereas 42.9 % in low concentration and also antioxidant test shows a better result for free radical scavenging. To understand the safety of the ZnO NRs zebrafish embryos was utilized as a model and found to be less toxic after assessment. Furthermore, to understand the anticancer activity of ZnO NRs it was assessed against breast cancer cell line through MTT, XTT, NRU, and LDH assay. The ZnO NRs exposed against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) had resulted in necrosis and apoptosis which was further confirmed by genotoxicity assay. Also, the molecular mechanisms behind the necrosis and apoptosis are also discussed to show the involvement of ZnO NRs towards breast cancer cells (MCF-7).

While the redox-active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbones might function as strong electron-donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high-valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo-transfer reactions. A conceptually parallel process might allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","bioinorganic chemistry; enzyme models; epoxidation; ligand design; nickel","Biomimetics; Enzymes; Epoxidation; Ligands; Metals; Olefins; Redox reactions; Catalytic efficiencies; Coordination sphere; Electron-donating ligands; Epoxidation reactions; High oxidation state; Multidentate ligands; Oxygen atom transfer; Redox active metal centers; Nickel compounds; metal; nickel; proton; biomimetics; catalysis; oxidation reduction reaction; Biomimetics; Catalysis; Metals; Nickel; Oxidation-Reduction; Protons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100536590

Although controlled nano-confinement of functional materials can allow modulation of their electronic properties without the aid of any synthetic methodologies or additional chemical treatments, limited assembly approaches for nano-confinement and insufficient analytical tools for electronic characterization remain critical challenges in the development of novel optoelectronic materials and the investigation of their modulated properties. This review describes how the nano-confined features of organic and inorganic materials are related to the control and improvement of their optoelectronic properties. In particular, we focus on various assembly approaches for effective nano-confinement as well as methods for nano-electronic characterization. Then, we briefly present challenges and perspectives on the direction of nano-confinement in terms of the preparation of optoelectronic materials with desired functionalities.

Institutions structure exchange relationships by determining transaction costs of searching for mutually beneficial agreements, bargaining over outcomes, and monitoring and enforcing decisions. The central implication for research is the need to account for the moderating role that political institutions play in sustainability policy decisions. A research agenda based on the PMF is advanced.

Existing results in the literature have been focusing mainly on the static obstacles. This paper is concerned with multi-arm manipulators with periodically moving obstacles. Due to the high-dimensional property and the moving obstacles, existing results suffer from finding the optimal path for given arbitrary starting and goal points. To solve the path planning problem, this paper presents a SAC-based (Soft actor–critic) path planning algorithm for multi-arm manipulators with periodically moving obstacles. In particular, the deep neural networks in the SAC are designed such that they utilize the position information of the moving obstacles over the past finite time horizon. In addition, the hindsight experience replay (HER) technique is employed to use the training data efficiently. In order to show the performance of the proposed SAC-based path planning, both simulation and experiment results using open manipulators are given. © 2021 by the authors.

It is possible to reduce the number of reinforcing bars placed in a building. Accordingly, as the amount of reinforcement decreases, the spacing of reinforcing bars increases, workability improves, and the construction period shortens. To evaluate the structural performance of high-strength reinforcing bars and the joint performance of high-strength threaded reinforcing bars, flexural performance tests were performed in this study on 12 beam members with the compressive strength of concrete, the yield strength of the tensile reinforcing bars, and the tensile reinforcing bar ratio as variables. The yield strengths of the tensile reinforcement and joint methods were used as variables, and joint performance tests were performed for six beam members. Based on this study, the foundation for using high-strength reinforcing bars with a design standard yield strength equal to 600 MPa was established. Accordingly, mechanical joints of high-strength threaded reinforcing bars (600 and 670 MPa) can be used. All six specimens were destroyed under more than the expected nominal strength. Lap splice caused brittle fractures because it was not reinforced in stirrup. Increases of 21% to 47% in the loads of specimens using a coupler and a lock nut were observed. Shape yield represents destruction-a section must ensure sufficient ductility after yielding. Therefore, a coupler and lock nut are effective. © 2021 by the authors.

The insulation performance of external walls is being continuously enhanced in the architectural domain. However, Korea’s policy and construction market focuses only on the heat resistance of buildings’ external walls to enhance the insulation performance, leading to an increased thickness of the insulation materials. In this study, the relationship between the surface reflectivity and insulation thickness of external walls was examined to formulate an effective insulation strategy for buildings in Korea. Office buildings of 12 regions in the Korean Peninsula were considered. The dynamic energy simulation program EnergyPlus was used to perform the heating and cooling load analyses. The present worth method was adopted to perform the economic analysis. The analysis of the cooling and heating loads indicated that a change occurred not only in terms of the latitude but also between the Eastern and Western regions. The energy consumption could be reduced by increasing the reflectivity in the Southern region and lowering the reflectivity in the Northern region, based on the total load. In addition, a higher latitude corresponded to a higher energy saving effect owing to the increased insulation thickness. In the case of Jeju Island and Busan, regions with a relatively large cooling load and small heating load, the total load is little affected by insulation thickness at high reflectivity. If the external skin was considered to have the optimal reflectivity, the regions for optimal insulation thickness could be divided into three categories: north, central and south. © 2021 by the authors.

Although 4D printing is an interest-ing and attractive phenomenon, it still faces several challenges before it can be used for practical applications: (i) the manufacturing cost should be competitive, and (ii) the shape transformations must have high dimensional accuracy and repeatability. In this study, an irreversible and repeatable thermoresponsive shape transformation method was developed using a material extrusion type AM process and a plain thermoplastic polymer (ABS) without a shape-memory function. Various types of annular discs were additively manufactured using printing paths programmed along a circular direction, and additional heat treatment was conducted as a thermal stimulus. The programmed circumferential anisotropy led to a unique 2D-to-3D shape transformation in response to the thermal stimulus. To obtain more predictable and repeatable shape transformation, the thermal stimulus was applied while using a geometric constraint. The relevant dimensional accuracy and repeatability of the constrained and unconstrained thermal deformations were compared. The proposed shape transformation method was further applied to AM and to the in situ assembly of a composite frame– membrane structure, where a functional membrane was integrated into a curved 3D frame without any additional assembly procedure. © 2021 by the authors.

The idea of an effective theory is applied to a system of collinear modes with large rapidity and soft modes with small rapidity. The large-rapidity (collinear) modes are integrated out to obtain the effective theory for the small-rapidity (soft) modes. The full SCET with the collinear and soft modes should be matched onto the soft theory at the rapidity boundary, and the matching procedure becomes exactly the zero-bin subtraction. The large-rapidity region is out of reach for the soft mode, which results in the rapidity divergence. The rapidity divergence in the collinear sector comes from the zero-bin subtraction, which ensures the cancellation of the rapidity divergences from the soft and collinear sectors. In order to treat the rapidity divergence, we construct the rapidity regulators consistently for all the modes. They are generalized by assigning independent rapidity scales for different collinear directions. The soft regulator incorporates the correct directional dependence when the innate collinear directions are not back-to-back, which is discussed in the N-jet operator. As an application, we consider the Sudakov form factor for the back-to-back collinear current and the soft-collinear current, where the soft rapidity regulator for a soft quark is developed. We extend the analysis to the boosted heavy quark sector and exploit the delicacy with the presence of the heavy quark mass. We present the resummed results of large logarithms in the form factors for various currents with the light and the heavy quarks, employing the renormalization group evolution on the renormalization and the rapidity scales. © 2021, The Author(s).","Effective Field Theories; Perturbative QCD; Resummation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103821534

Generally, when the applied torque is greater than the maximum allowable torque, balls in V-Hole get out from the holes and the coupling loses the torque transfer capability. After balls are out from the V-Holes, the balls and V-Hole rotate at a different velocity. When balls meet the next V-Hole, they collide into the wall of the V-Hole. Due to this collision, plastic deformation and wear take place. The plastic deformation and wear may reduce the torque transfer capability of the safety coupling. The reduction in torque transfer capability was observed in the experiment. In this study, plastic deformation of balls and flange was investigated through dynamic analysis of the safety coupling. Also, the effect of relative rotational velocity on the plastic deformation was investigated.

The C-GFB consists of bump foil structures and three PZT actuators, and the PZT actuators push the bump foil structures in different displacements according to the driving voltage, enabling preload control. In order to predict the piezoelectric preload according to the driving voltage, an equivalent spring model for PZT actuators and foil structures is introduced. In addition, PZT parameters (a piezoelectric constant and stiffness) are measured through parameter identification tests using a latch. Next, static lubrication analysis for C-GFB reveals that the gas-film pressure reduces the effect of piezoelectric preload by up to a maximum of 11%, because the piezoelectric actuator has structural com-pliance so that it is structurally deformed by the pressure. Finally, nonlinear orbit simulation is per-formed, and the performance of real-time vibration control of C-GFB is evaluated. The real-time preload control is carried out at ~32.6 krpm, where the rotordynamic instability sufficiently occurs. As the driving voltage increases, the instability suppression and delay effect increase. In particular, when controlled at 150 V, the onset speed of the instability increases to 79.1 krpm. Consequently, this study demonstrates that the GFB with piezoelectric preloads is a simple, effective, and real-time method to improve the rotordynamic stability. © 2021 by the authors.

The samples were made with replacing Portland cement with 10 mass‐% silica fume, metakaolin or glass powder. The reaction degree of SCMs estimated by the portlandite consumption shows that metakaolin has the highest reaction degree, thus metakaolin‐blended PC exhibits the highest strength. The control exposed to seawater exhibited 14.82% and 12.14% higher compressive strengths compared to those cured in tap water at 7 and 28 days. The samples incorporating metakaolin showed the highest compressive strength of 76.60 MPa at 90 days tap water curing and this was 17% higher than that of the control. Exposure to seawater is found to retard the rate of hydration in all SCM‐incorporating systems, while the strength development of the neat PC system is enhanced.

When there are many specific tasks that the agent must go through to reach the final goal, the reward signal becomes very sparse in the environment. And this situation makes reinforcement learning less effective. To overcome this, we give the agent an intrinsic reward to induce the agent to explore more. With this reward setting, the agent can continue to search for reward signal and learn another action that is better than the best action which is currently known. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the proposed method and estimate its performance.

First, the cepstrum analysis method combined with order analysis was applied to the vibration signal to detect periodic responses in the spectrum for a rotating body such as a wheel. In the case of railway vehicles, changes in speed occur while driving. Thus, it is difficult to effectively evaluate the flat signal of the wheel because the time cycle of the flat signal changes frequently. Thus, the order analysis was combined with the existing cepstrum analysis method to consider the changes in train speed. The order analysis changes the domain of the vibration signal from time domain to rotating angular domain to consider the train speed change in the cepstrum analysis. Second, the cross correlation analysis method combined with the order analysis was applied to evaluate the flat signal from the vibration signal well containing the severe field noise pro-duced by the vibrations of the rail irregularities and bogie components. Unlike the cepstrum analysis method, it can find out the wheel flat size because the flat signal linearly increases to the wheel flat. Thus, it is more effective when checking the size of the wheel flat. Finally, the data tested in the Korea Railroad Research Institute were used to confirm that the cepstrum analysis and cross correlation analysis methods are appropriate for not only simulation but also test data. © 2021 by the authors.

A triangular monopole antenna with a semicircular stub is made frequency and pattern tunable by connecting and disconnecting two inverted L‐shaped stubs utilizing diodes. When either of the stubs is connected to the radiator, a relative phase difference happens at both ends of the radiator that changes the direction of the electromagnetic radiations, consequently pattern reconfigurability can be obtain. Besides that, because of the reactive load introduced by the stubs, the antenna’s effective length has changed and, as a result, the frequency reconfigurability can be attained. The antenna features a compact size of 40 × 50 × 0.254 mm3 corre-sponding to 0.22λo × 0.27λo × 0.001λo, where λo is free‐space wavelength at 1.65 GHz, while its opera-tional bandwidth is from 1.65 GHz to 2.51 GHz, with an average gain and radiation efficiency of better than 2.2 dBi and 80%, exhibiting a pattern reconfigurability of 180° in the E‐plane. The frequency of the proposed antenna can be switched from 2.1 GHz to 1.8 GHz by switching the state of both diodes in OFF and ON‐state, respectively. The fabricated prototype of the antenna is tested to verify its performance parameters. In addition, to validate the proposed design, it has been compared with prior arts in terms of the overall size, reconfigurability type, flexibility, radio frequency (RF) switch type used for reconfigurability, and frequency bandwidth. The proposed antenna provides smaller size with a large bandwidth coverage alongside with discrete RF switch type with the advantages of flexibility and both frequency and pattern reconfigurability. As a result, the proposed compact flexible and pattern reconfigurable antenna is a promising candidate for heterogeneous applications, including the global system for mobile (GSM) band (1800 and 1900 MHz) and industri-al, scientific and medical (ISM) band (2.4 GHz) along with well‐known cellular communication bands of 3G, 4G, and long term evolution (LTE) bands ranging from 1700–2300 MHz around the globe. © 2021 by the authors.

The proposed converter is constructed using nonregulating two-phase interleaved totem-pole converter switched with a fixed 50% duty on the grid side and a full-bridge on the dc-side for active power and dc output regulation. This switching method results in a ripple-free grid current regardless of the magnitude of the input inductances. Consequently, a proper design of input inductance secures soft switching for all switches under wide voltage and load ranges without an auxiliary circuit or resonant tank. Hence, the proposed topology overcomes the reverse recovery issue, thereby enabling the use of Si devices in CCM. Moreover, the current spike around the ac main zero-crossing is avoided in the CCM operation due to small rectified voltage around zero-crossing. Furthermore, the instantaneous powers at the grid side and dc-side are identical since the proposed topology is electrolytic capacitorless with inherent second harmonic ripple current at the dc-side. PFC is inherently performed in the proposed converter without a current shaping control loop, and the phase-shift angle is the only control variable. Hence, the control system is simple and reliable. A 3.3 kW prototype of the proposed converter is built and tested in order to verify the performance and the theoretical claims. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","AC-DC converter; electrolytic capacitorless; high-frequency (HF) isolation; interleaved; single-stage; soft-switching; totem-pole bridgeless PFC","Control systems; Electric inverters; Electrolytic capacitors; Inductance; Poles; Topology; Zero voltage switching; AC-DC conversions; Auxiliary circuits; Electrolytic capacitor-less; High-frequency isolation; Instantaneous power; Output regulation; Rectified voltage; Switching methods; Rectifying circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095687172

To conduct a reasonable operational rating, it is necessary to develop a rational and reliable CO2 emission (CE) benchmark for buildings. The conventional CE benchmarks, however, have limitations accounting for regional differences of multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs). Thus, a separate CE benchmark is required for each region for improving the rationale and reliability of the conventional CE benchmarks. To solve this problem, a data-driven approach for establishing a CE benchmark using data mining techniques was applied in this study. Data on a total of 1,212 MFHCs were established, and a total of 11 CE benchmarks (central region: 7; southern region: 4) for MFHCs were established based on the decision tree. The developed CE benchmarks were then validated using statistical methods (Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, etc.). Compared to the average operational rating based on conventional CE benchmarks, the average operational rating based on the newly developed CE benchmarks decreased by 1.85% in the central region, and increased by 5.19% in the southern region, respectively. This means that the unreliability and irrationality of the conventional operational rating system (ORS) can be solved by the established ORS. The established ORS, based on the newly developed CE benchmarks, can help policymakers select and manage MFHCs with poor CE performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions benchmark; Data mining techniques; Decision tree; Multi-family housing complex; Operational rating system","Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Decision trees; Housing; Trees (mathematics); Building sectors; CO2 emissions; Data-driven approach; Kruskal-Wallis tests; Multi-family housings; Policy makers; Rating system; Regional differences; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094112203

To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, named Temporal Filtering Network, to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information from a partially observed, untrimmed video. Specifically, we present a filtering module to learn relevance scores indicating how relevant the information is to a current action. Our filtering module emphasizes the relevant information to a current action, while it filters out the information of background and unrelated actions. We conduct extensive experiments on THUMOS-14 and TVSeries datasets. On these datasets, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We also show the effectiveness of the filtering module through comprehensive ablation studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Filter modules; Online action detection; Temporal filtering networks; TFN","Large dataset; Input videos; Large margins; Partial information; Relevance score; State-of-the-art methods; Streaming videos; Temporal filtering; Information filtering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092730964

It shows a low permeability for vanadium ions, a conductivity in the range of 5 mS cm−1 in contact with 2 M sulfuric acid, and resists degradation by VO2+. Recent literature showed that the conductivity of PBI can be increased to 18 mS cm−1 by pre-swelling the membrane with phosphoric acid (PA), and up to 590 mS cm−1 by casting a sulfonated para-PBI membrane from polyphosphoric acid before immersion in sulfuric acid. However, these membranes show an increased permeability towards VO2+ ions, and thus reduced coulomb efficiency in the VRFB. Here we investigate pre-swelling in 4 M alkaline solution. It increases the conductivity in 2 M sulfuric acid to 56 (potassium hydroxide) and 12 mS cm−1 (sodium hydroxide). In 3 M sulfuric acid, the NaOH swollen membrane (4N3S) shows 14 mS cm−1, corresponding to an area resistance of 69 mΩ cm2 for a 10 µm thick membrane, lower than that of Nafion 115 (192 mΩ cm2) and even Nafion 212 (89 mΩ cm2).

T-S curves are calibrated by comparing experimental data of compact tension specimens with finite element analysis results. The calibrated T-S curves are utilized to predict the fracture behavior of cracked pipes. Three types of full-scale pipe tests are considered: pipe with circumferential through-wall crack under quasi-static/dynamic loadings, and with 360° internal surface crack under quasi-static loading.

In this study, we fabricated flexible barrier films of single-layer silicon nitride (SiNx) and silicon oxide (SiOx) on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. We investigated the stability and degradation mechanism of SiNx and SiOx barrier films at high temperature and under high humidity using water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) measurements and cyclic bending tests. The changes in chemical composition, film density, surface roughness, and WVTR were analyzed after environmental reliability tests. It was found that high temperature and high humidity induced oxidation of the SiNx and SiOx films, resulting in an increase in the surface roughness and decrease in the film density. The SiOx film was oxidized faster than the SiNx film and formed large hillocks on the surface.

Over the past decade, many studies on membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems for wastewater applications demonstrated that disrupting cell-cell communications among bacteria, called quorum quenching (QQ), is a promising approach to inhibit biofouling of membranes. Here, we developed the QQ-column as a novel strategy to control biofouling in RO systems. The QQ-column was prepared by incorporating a recombinant bacterial QQ strain into hydrogel beads and embedding these beads inside a column. The QQ-column was installed upstream of the RO module to degrade N-acyl homoserine lactone, a quorum sensing (QS) signal, from the feed in a laboratory-scale RO system operating in total recycle mode. The QQ-column reduced the concentrations of signal molecules by ∼29% in an RO system and mitigated biofilm formation (38.6% reduction of cell number) on the membrane, consequently reducing the transmembrane pressure by 50.1%. These results demonstrate that integrating QQ bacteria into columns is a practical method to control biofouling in RO systems. © 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","Biofouling; Quorum quenching; Quorum sensing; Reverse osmosis; Water reclamation","Bacteria; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Operating costs; Quenching; Reverse osmosis; Biofilm formation; Cell-cell communications; High energy requirements; Membrane bio reactor (MBR); N-Acyl Homoserine lactones; Transmembrane pressures; Wastewater applications; Water treatment process; Biofouling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096084250

In this paper, we propose a multi-filter design for effective decoding of WiFi backscattered signals. Backscattered signals are relatively weak compared to carrier WiFi signals and therefore require algorithms that filter out original WiFi signals without affecting the backscattered signals. Two multi-filter designs for WiFi backscatter decoding are presented: the summation and delimiter approaches. Both implementations employ the use of additional filters with different window sizes to efficiently cut off undesired noise/interference, thus enhancing frame detection and decoding performance, and can be coupled with a wide range of decoding algorithms. The designs are particularly productive in the frequency-shift WiFi backscatter communication. We demonstrate via prototyping and testbed experiments that the proposed design enhances the performance of various decoding algorithms in real environments.","frequency-shift; IoT; multi-filter design; WiFi backscatter communication","algorithm; article; filter design; noise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102693596

We investigated the physical, optical, and antioxidant properties of FM1, FM2, and FM3 nanoparticles by conducting UV, Raman, FTIR, and EDX spectroscopic analyses along with DPPH radical scavenging activity. Results showed the highest DPPH scavenging activity in the FM2 group (50.76%), while the activity in the FM1 and FM3 groups was 23.60% and 34.63%, respectively. In addition, topical application of nanoparticles induced significant but different anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in Dermatophagoides farinae extract/2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DFE/DNCB)-sensitized BALB/c mice. The FM2 treatment alleviates more effectively the DFE/DNCB-induced atopic dermatitis-like (AD-like) symptoms in mouse ears (edema, excoriation, scaling, and hemorrhage). In comparison with the DFE/DNCB-sensitized mice, FM2 treatment greatly reduced the size and weight of the spleen and the lymph nodes. It also suppressed mast cell infiltration (2-fold) and reduced dermal and epidermal thickness in mice. In addition, FM2 treatment exhibited better inhibition of the mRNA levels of Th1 (IFN-γand TNF-α) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-31), as well as the levels of various inflammation-related proteins (COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α). Moreover, we demonstrated that an increasing proportion of Fe3+ in Fe2+: Fe3+ enhances the antioxidant activity and increases the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of γ-Fe2O3 NPs in an AD mouse model.

Most traditional approaches use a statistical method to model the background image. Recently, deep learning has also been widely used to detect foreground objects in video surveillance. It shows dramatic improvement compared to the traditional approaches. It is trained through supervised learning, which requires training samples with pixel-level assignment. It requires a huge amount of time and is high cost, while traditional algorithms operate unsupervised and do not require training samples. Additionally, deep learning-based algorithms lack generalization power. They operate well on scenes that are similar to the training conditions, but they do not operate well on scenes that deviate from the training conditions. In this paper, we present a new method to detect foreground objects in video surveillance using multiple difference images as the input of convolutional neural networks, which guarantees improved generalization power compared to current deep learning-based methods. First, we adjust U-Net to use multiple difference images as input. Second, we show that training using all scenes in the CDnet 2014 dataset can improve the generalization power. Hyper-parameters such as the number of difference images and the interval between images in difference image computation are chosen by analyzing experimental results. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves improved performance in scenes that are not used in training compared to state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional unsupervised algorithms. Diverse experiments using various open datasets and real images show the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

The simple model that considers the elastic behavior of a cylinder-shaped polymer layer is introduced, and the structural stiffness of the layer is estimated based on Hooke’s law for differential elements in the layer. In addition, the simple model is coupled with the structural stiffness of the bump foil in consideration with a series relationship, which represents the structural model of GFPBs. A GFPB with thickness of 2 mm is fabricated, and the structural model is validated via static-load deflection tests for the GFPB. As a result of model validation, the proposed model is found to be effective in predicting the elastic behavior under the lightly loaded condition of GFPB. Next, the static performances of GFPBs, namely, gas-film pressure, thickness, and journal positions with respect to different polymer layer thickness, are analyzed to evaluate rotordynamic stability of GFPBs. The results indicate that high thickness yields an increase in damping and a decrease in cross-coupled effects. Specifically, in this study, 3 mm-thick polymer gives the best stability performance given the predicted effective damping results. As a result, this work provides a reasonable model for structural elasticity of GFPBs and lays a foundation for the widespread use of GFPBs. © 2021 by the authors.

Although the New Austrian tunneling method (NATM)—a representative tunnel excavation method—can be applied to various ground conditions, as well as having good constructability and economic feasibility, it suffers from problems such as vibration and noise. By contrast, excavation using a tunnel boring machine (TBM)—a representative mechanized construction method—affords advantages such as stable excavation, minimized ground and environmental damage, noise, and vibration. However, it cannot be applied easily to various ground conditions, and it suffers from problems such as high construction costs and delays owing to equipment defects. Therefore, the simultaneous pilot tunnel excavation using the TBM—which affords advantages such as constructability, economic feasibility, and minimized noise and vibration— and rear enlargement blasting using NATM was investigated in this study.

This study attempted to project future drought characteristics in the Cheongmicheon watershed using SSP2-4.5 of Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator-coupled model (ACCESS-CM2) in addition to Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 of ACCESS 1-3 of the same institute. The historical precipitation and temperature data of ACCESS-CM2 were generated better than those of ACCESS 1-3. Two meteorological drought indices, namely, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were used to project meteorological drought while a hydrological drought index, Standardized Streamflow Index (SDI), was used to project the hydrological drought characteristics. The metrological data of GCMs were bias-corrected using quantile mapping method and the streamflow was obtained using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and bias-corrected meteorological data. As a result, there were large differences of drought occurrences and severities between RCP4.5 and SSP2-4.5 for the values of SPI, SPEI, and SDI. The differences in the minimum values of drought index between near (2021–2060) and far futures (2061–2100) were very small in SSP2-4.5, while those in RCP4.5 were very large. In addition, the longest drought period from SDI was the largest because the variation in precipitation usually affects the streamflow with a lag. Therefore, it was concluded that it is important to consider both CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCMs in establishing the drought countermeasures for the future period. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose a multi-filter design for effective decoding of WiFi backscattered signals. Backscattered signals are relatively weak compared to carrier WiFi signals and therefore require algorithms that filter out original WiFi signals without affecting the backscattered signals. Two multi-filter designs for WiFi backscatter decoding are presented: the summation and delimiter approaches. Both implementations employ the use of additional filters with different window sizes to efficiently cut off undesired noise/interference, thus enhancing frame detection and decoding performance, and can be coupled with a wide range of decoding algorithms. The designs are particularly productive in the frequency-shift WiFi backscatter communication. We demonstrate via prototyping and testbed experiments that the proposed design enhances the performance of various decoding algorithms in real environments. © 2021 by the authors.

To install the façade, the complex geometric shapes of the façade need to be divided into panels. The panels developed are classified into three categories in terms of their curvatures, i.e., planar, single-curved, double-curved panels. The quality of the curved façade is determined by the geometric difference between as-built and as-designed panel shapes. Among the three types of curved panels, the double-curved panel is very difficult to form, showing greater quality discrepancy than the other two panel types. Ensuring the as-built quality of the curved façade is for contractors. The main objective of this study is to enhance small/mid-size contractors’ capacity of managing the as-built quality of the double-curved panel. To meet the study objectives, a case study of a small free-form building and empirical mock-up tests of curved panels were performed and beneficial lessons for the contractors were identified through the tests. Among diverse materials, aluminum and glass-fiber-reinforced concrete (GFRC) were utilized for the mock-up tests. Three-dimensional laser scanning technology was employed to foster the as-built data of the case study project and the mocked-up double-curved panels. The data superimposition method was used to measure the deviation between the as-designed and the as-built data of the case study. © 2021 by the authors.

Most DC motor-based FWMAVs employ linkage structures, such as a crank-rocker or a crank-slider, which are designed to transmit the motor’s rotating motion to the wing’s flapping motion. These transmitting linkages have shown successful performance; however, they entail the possibility of mechanical wear originating from the friction between relative moving components and require an onerous assembly process owing to several tiny components. To reduce the assembly process and wear problems, we present a geometrically constrained and origami-based spherical six-bar linkage. The origami-based fabrication method reduces the number of the relative moving components by replacing rigid links and pin joints with facets and folding joints, which shortens the assembly process and reduces friction between components. The constrained spherical six-bar linkage enables us to change the motor’s rotating motion to the linear reciprocating motion. Due to the property that every axis passes through a single central point, the motor’s rotating motion is filtered at the spherical linkage and does not transfer to the flapping wing. Only linear motion, therefore, is passed to the flapping wing. To show the feasibility of the idea, a prototype is fabricated and analyzed by measuring the flapping angle, the wing rotation angle and the thrust. © 2021 by the authors.

Some of these applications require real-time 2D graphics processing running on limited design specifications such as low power consumption and a small area. In order to satisfy such conditions, including a specific 2D graphics accelerator in the embedded system is an effective method. This method reduces the workload of the processor in the embedded system by exploiting the accelerator. The accelerator assists the system to perform 2D graphics processing in real-time. Therefore, a variety of applications that require 2D graphics processing can be implemented with an embedded processor. In this paper, we present a 2D graphics accelerator for tiny embedded systems. The accelerator includes an optimized line-drawing operation based on Bresenham’s algorithm. The optimized operation enables the accelerator to deal with various kinds of 2D graphics processing and to perform the line-drawing instead of the system processor. Moreover, the accelerator also distributes the workload of the processor core by removing the need for the core to access the frame buffer memory.

The main objective of current paper is to investigate the effects of initial responses for the release accidents of hydrofluoric acid. For this, a simplified equation that can easily calculate the effect distance by varying concentrations of hydrofluoric acid was firstly deduced. In addition, a causal loops for the initial response steps using the system dynamics technique was constructed during release of 50% hydrofluoric acid. The effect distances according to different scenarios of the initial actions were also quantitatively analyzed by applying the simplified equation to the causal map. As a result, the highest reduction rate on the maximum effect distance was obtained with 'start time of action after leak detection' being about 87% while the lowest was 'arrival time of professional response team' being about 50%, as expected.

Although modern injection molding simulators are able to evaluate such pressure drops, they are expensive and demanding to be employed as a design utility. This work develops a computer tool that can calculate a pressure drop from the sprue to the gate assuming a steady flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid. For a four drop hot runner system, the accuracy has been verified by comparing the obtained results with those by a commercial simulator.

A micro-channel unit for synthesizing liposomes consisted of two micro-nozzle arrays for mixing two solutions as well as delivery and recovery channels for supplying solutions and collecting liposome suspension. The number of micro-nozzles was approximately 2400 for a micro-channel unit, and seven units were applied independently on a micro-channel plate. The plastic micro-channel plate was injection-molded for mass production using a micro-channel stamper previously fabricated by UV lithography and nickel electroforming process. A plastic cover plate with seven pairs of inlet and outlet ports was machined by mechanical milling and drilling and was assembled with a micro-channel plate using a holder to form a liposome synthesizing device. Flow and mixing of solutions in the micro-channels were tested using colored water to check the micro-fluidic characteristics of the device. Finally, a L-α-phosphatidylcholine (SOY PC) liposome was synthesized using EtOH solution of SOY PC (95%) and saline (0.85% NaOH solution) to find that the liposomes were around 230 and 260 nm in diameter, depending on the flow rate of the lipid solution. © 2021 by the authors.

The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) provides an open and neutral data format to standardize data exchanges in BIM, but is often exposed to data loss and misclassifications. Concretely, errors in mappings between BIM elements and IFC entities may occur due to manual omissions or the lack of awareness of the IFC schema itself, which is broadly defined and highly complex. This study explored the use of geometric deep learning models to classify infrastructure BIM elements, with the ultimate goal of automating the prechecking of BIM-to-IFC mappings. Two models with proven classification performance, Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN) and PointNet, were trained and tested to classify 10 types of commonly used BIM elements in road infrastructure, using a dataset of 1496 3D models. Results revealed MVCNN as the superior model with ACC and F1 score values of 0.98 and 0.98, compared with PointNet's corresponding values of 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. MVCNN, which employs multiple images to learn the features of a 3D artifact, was able to discern subtle differences in their shapes and geometry. PointNet seems to lose the granularity of the shapes, as it uses points partially selected from point clouds. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The 40M‐FTO sample exhibited optimized electrical and optical properties due to the improved crystallinity and net‐patterned surface morphology of FTO. The electrochromic (EC) electrodes fabricated with 40M‐FTO showed superior EC performance, including transmittance modulation (ΔT, 58.7%), switching speeds (4.1 s for coloration and 5.9 s for bleaching), and coloration efficiency (CE, 52.4 cm2/C). These optimum values were attributed to the combined effect of the enhanced electrical properties from the improved crystal-linity of the SnO2 and the high transmittance with a large surface area stemming from the optimization of the net‐patterned FTO surface morphology. Moreover, the improved reaction sites with large surface area and enhanced electrical conductivity can facilitate the photocatalytic reaction.

The highest amount of erosion is observed in Rangeland (52.2%) followed by rainfed agriculture (15.1%) and barren land (9.8%) while a little or no erosion is found in areas with fruit trees, forest and shrubs, and irrigated agriculture land. The highest soil erosion was observed in summer (June–August) due to snow melting from high mountains. The spatial distribution of soil erosion revealed higher risk in foothills and degraded lands.

To optimize the preparation of Alg-PCH, various reaction conditions (alginate, CaCl2 concentration, bead size, and weight ratio between alginate and PCH) were utilized. According to the toluene adsorption–desorption experiments, the preparation conditions for Alg-PCH were selected as a 2 mm extrusion tip, 0.5% of alginate, and 2% of CaCl2 solution with a 1:50 alginate:PCH weight ratio. Additionally, it shows 61.63 mg/g adsorption capacity with around 49% desorption efficacy under atmospheric temperature and pressure. © 2021 by the authors.

When it comes to medical image segmentation, its accuracy is even more important than those of other areas because the performance gives useful information directly applicable to disease diagnosis, surgical planning, and history monitoring. The state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation are variants of encoder-decoder architecture, which is called U-Net. To effectively reflect the spatial features in feature maps in encoder-decoder architecture, we propose a spatially adaptive weighting scheme for medical image segmentation. Specifically, the spatial feature is estimated from the feature maps, and the learned weighting parameters are obtained from the computed map, since segmentation results are predicted from the feature map through a convolutional layer. Especially in the proposed networks, the convolutional block for extracting the feature map is replaced with the widely used convolutional frameworks: VGG, ResNet, and Bottleneck Resent structures. In addition, a bilinear up-sampling method replaces the up-convolutional layer to increase the resolution of the feature map. For the performance evaluation of the proposed architecture, we used three data sets covering different medical imaging modalities. Experimental results show that the network with the proposed self-spatial adaptive weighting block based on the ResNet framework gave the highest IoU and DICE scores in the three tasks compared to other methods. In particular, the segmentation network combining the proposed self-spatially adaptive block and ResNet framework recorded the highest 3.01% and 2.89% improvements in IoU and DICE scores, respectively, in the Nerve data set. Therefore, we believe that the proposed scheme can be a useful tool for image segmentation tasks based on the encoder-decoder architecture. © 2021 by the authors.

It was found that the influence of the chemical composition and reduction temperature greatly alters the phase formation, its structures, particle size distribution, and magnetic properties of Fe–Co–Ni nanocomposites. The initial hydroxides of Fe–Co–Ni combinations were prepared by the co-precipitation method from nitrate precursors and precipitated using alkali. The reduction process was carried out by hydrogen in the temperature range of 300–500 °C under isothermal conditions. The nanocomposites had metallic and intermetallic phases with different lattice parameter values due to the increase in Fe content. In this paper, we showed that the values of the magnetic parameters of nanocomposites can be controlled in the ranges of MS = 7.6–192.5 Am2/kg, Mr = 0.4–39.7 Am2/kg, Mr/Ms = 0.02–0.32, and HcM = 4.72–60.68 kA/m by regulating the composition and reduction temperature of the Fe–Co–Ni composites. Due to the reduction process, drastic variations in the magnetic features result from the intermetallic and metallic face formation. The variation in magnetic characteristics is guided by the reduction degree, particle size growth, and crystallinity enhancement. Moreover, the reduction of the surface spins fraction of the nanocomposites under their growth induced an increase in the saturation magnetization. This is the first report where the influence of Fe content on the Fe–Co–Ni ternary system phase content and magnetic properties was evaluated. The Fe–Co–Ni ternary nanocomposites obtained by co-precipitation, followed by the hydrogen reduction led to the formation of better magnetic materials for various magnetically coupled device applications. © 2021 by the authors.

As a part of these technologies, the energy cloud is a technology that maximizes the efficiency of energy resources through the organic connection between the entities that produce and consume the energy. However, the disruption or destruction of energy cloud systems through cyberattacks can lead to incidents such as massive blackouts, which can lead to national disasters. Furthermore, since the technique and severity of modern cyberattacks continue to improve, the energy cloud environment must be designed to resist cyberattacks. However, since the energy cloud environment has different characteristics from general infrastructures such as the smart grid and the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), it requires security technology specialized to its environment. This paper proposes a cyber threat intelligence framework to improve the energy cloud environment’s security. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is a technology to actively respond to advanced cyber threats by collecting and analyzing various threat indicators and generating contextual knowledge about the cyber threats. The framework proposed in this paper analyzes threat indicators that can be collected in the advanced metering infrastructure and proposes a cyber threat intelligence generation technique targeting the energy cloud. This paper also proposes a method that can quickly apply a security model to a large-scale energy cloud infrastructure through a mechanism for sharing and spreading cyber threat intelligence between the AMI layer and the cloud layer. Our framework provides a way to effectively apply the proposed technologies through the CTI architecture, including the local AMI layer, the station layer, and the cloud layer. Furthermore, we show that the proposed framework can effectively respond to cyber threats by showing a 0.822 macro-F1 score and a 0.843 micro-F1 score for cyberattack detection in an environment that simulates a model of an attacker and an energy cloud environment. © 2020 by the authors.

Specimens with various distributions of DP and CP were prepared under a wide range of aging conditions. As quantitative microstructural factors of DP and CP, area fraction of DPs and CP/α-Mg interfaces per unit volume were measured by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To explain the tensile fracture mechanism, a deformation twinning behavior was analyzed using OM and electron back-scattered diffraction, and area fraction of stepped cleavage facet was quantitatively measured on a large number of fractographs. An increase in the area fraction of DPs caused a slight decrease in the tensile elongation and this reduction was attributed to cracking at the DP along grain boundary. For the specimens with high CP/α-Mg interfaces per unit volume, a large number of fine {10−12} tension twins were produced within a few percent of tensile elongation as well as premature fracture occurred. In this investigation, the premature fracture mechanism of the aging-treated AZ91D alloy with a large amount of fine CP distribution was explained in relation with the increased probability of {10–12} tension twin boundary cracking, although activation of {10–12} tension twinning can be a way to facilitate deformation of some Mg alloys in previous researches. Validity of the suggested premature fracture mechanism was supported by the quantitative measurement of area fraction of the stepped cleavage facet on the fractography as indirect evidence of the twin boundary cracking. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Elongation; Fracture mechanism; Magnesium alloy; Precipitate; Twinning","Cracks; Elongation; Fractography; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Grain boundaries; Magnesium metallography; Precipitation (chemical); Probability distributions; Scanning electron microscopy; Twinning; AZ91D magnesium alloys; Deformation twinning; Discontinuous precipitates; Electron back-scattered diffraction; Fracture mechanisms; Microstructural factors; Quantitative measurement; Quantitative microscopy; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099002083

The behaviors of plastic J-integral and COD of a non-idealized axial TWC in typical pressurized pipes in nuclear power plants were systematically investigated. The FE model and analysis procedure employed in this study were verified by comparing the present FE results with the limited existing solutions for pipes with an idealized axial TWC.

By employing the plastic influence functions, plastic J-integral and COD of a non-idealized axial TWC along crack front can be directly predicted based on GE/EPRI method. In the present paper, plastic J-integral and COD estimates based on the reference stress concept have also been suggested. Finally, the estimated results were compared with elastic-plastic FE results by using actual stress-strain data and Ramberg-Osgood constants for TP 316 stainless steel. In addition, the engineering estimates proposed in this study were extended to estimating the creep fracture mechanics parameters at elevated temperature. Based on Norton and RCC-MRx creep models, C*-integral and creep COD rate values predicted from the present engineering solutions were validated by comparing with creep FE results.

There is a growing interest in understanding the online travel marketplace among hospitality researchers. Although many researchers have attempted to better understand the online travel market through the use of analytical models, experiments, or survey collection, these studies often fail to capture the full complexity of the market. Academics often rely upon survey data or experiments owing to their ease of collection or potentially to the difficulty in assembling online data. In this study, we hope to equip hospitality researchers with the tools and methods to augment their traditional data sources with the readily available data that consumers use to make their travel choices. In this article, we provide a guideline (and Python code) for how to best collect/scrape publicly available online hotel data. We focus on the collection of online data across numerous platforms, including online travel agents, review sites, and hotel brand sites.

The bidirectional three-phase current-fed dc-dc converters are known to be suitable for wide voltage range applications compared to dual active bridge based converters, having advantages of reduced device current ratings and prevention of transformer saturation due to high impedance nature. However, when the duty cycle becomes lower than 0.33 or higher than 0.66, power transfer capability is limited, and the efficiency is significantly reduced due to increased circulating current, which has rarely been discussed so far. In this article, a hybrid dual-asymmetrical pulsewidth modulation (DAPWM) and pulsewidth modulation plus phase-shift (PPS) switching method is proposed for efficiency improvement of the bidirectional three-phase push-pull converter with very wide voltage range. A seamless mode change method between PPS and DAPWM is also proposed for minimizing the transient state. Further, through current waveform and power flow analysis, the leakage inductance along with transformer turn ratio are designed to minimize the root mean square (rms) current of devices, while having the capability of transferring the desired power and limiting the slew rate of transformer winding current under wide voltage range operation.

Homonyms are a source of noise i most text analyses and are difficult to detect; numerous studies have been conducted in this regard. However, extant methods typically detect homonyms using a rule-based or statistical-based approach, which requires an answer set, with little regard to the semantic meaning of the word. Therefore, we propose a novel approach for the detection of homonyms based on contextual word embedding that allows a word to be understood based on the context in which it appears. In this study, we extracted all contextual word embedding vectors of individual words and clustered those vectors using a spherical k-means clustering to detect pairs of homonyms. In addition, we developed a homonym replacement method to increase the performance of a document embedding technique, based on the word vector value. We replaced the embedding vectors of homonyms with a representative vector based on the respective meaning using the proposed homonym detection method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively detects homonyms and significantly improves the performance of document embedding. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Contextual word embedding; ELMo; Homonym detection; Spherical k-means clustering; Word-clustering based document embedding","K-means clustering; Semantics; Vectors; Common features; Contextual words; Detection methods; Embedding technique; Replacement methods; Source of noise; Text analysis; Word vectors; Embeddings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092921527

In a key study of smartphone user segmentation, Lee et al. analyzed app usage sequencing using seq2seq architecture. However, despite achieving meaningful results, their approach could not provide a robust interpretation of user segmentation because the seq2seq architecture represented users in a continuous vector space generated from a black box model. In this paper, we propose an interpretable user representation method that combines app clustering with a novel segmentation method. The user representation clusters characteristically similar apps into common clusters, with each user represented by their frequencies of app use within their respective clusters. Two novel techniques are also applied to normalize the value of user representation based on the relative degrees of importance between app clusters and the membership strengths of individual apps within a cluster. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing segmentation methods, in which the most closely located users are assigned to specific clusters, the proposed method segments represented users using a novel segmentation approach based on relative similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an intuitive interpretation for each user’s representation and segmentation results. Furthermore, we effectively show the similarities between the results produced by our method and ground truth and demonstrate that it outperforms existing user segmentation methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","App clustering; Louvain method; Modularity detection; Relative similarity; User representation; User segmentation","Multimedia systems; Black-box model; Essential elements; Novel techniques; Relative degrees; Representation method; Segmentation methods; Segmentation results; User segmentation; Vector spaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092336020

The redox reactivity of Co(TiPA) and Fe(TiPA) adopting TiPA ligand is measured and their reaction mechanism is compared with that of complexes containing triethanolamine (TEA) ligand (Co(TEA) and Fe(TEA)) that are conventionally considered. According to evaluations, the reaction rate of all complexes is controlled by their diffusion rate. In a comparison of the complexes, that of TEA complexes is faster than that of TiPA complexes. This means that the viscosity of TEA complexes is lower than that of TiPA complexes. However, regarding the stability in KOH, the stability of TiPA complexes is much better than that of TEA complexes, enabling the stable redox reactions over a long period. Considering the reduction potential of complexes and their stabilization constant, TiPA complexes have a higher stabilization constant than TEA complexes because the redox reaction of TiPA complexes is stably performed, whereas the Fe ions of Fe(TEA) are precipitated for charging process and the preciptation induces irreversible reaction in KOH. This is confirmed by the solidified Fe atoms observed onto carbon felt after RFB test.

Catalytic reduction of nitrates using Pd-Cu is one of the most promising technologies to achieve complete removal of nitrate; however, the effect of a range of experimental factors on the nitrate removal rate and N2 selectivity is still an ongoing concern. Two kinds of supporting materials, alumina and activated carbon felt, were used to immobilize the Pd-Cu catalyst. The alumina-based catalyst was used to establish reference conditions for further experiments, and the effect of pH control was evaluated for both supporting materials. It was observed that pH has a direct influence on the nitrate reduction rate as well as the N2 selectivity. Nitrate reduction efficiency was low at acidic conditions while the highest N2 selectivity was obtained at the acidic conditions. The optimal pH condition for Pd-Cu/activated carbon felt was determined as pH 4, showing the highest total nitrogen removal as N2 gas. Finally, the feasibility of catalytic nitrate reduction for reverse osmosis concentrate was evaluated by investigating the effects of organic and inorganic components commonly present in reverse osmosis concentrate. The organic and inorganic components did not show a significant inhibitory effect on catalytic nitrate reduction, while a high concentration of salt significantly decreased the nitrate reduction rate as well as the N2 selectivity. The filter type morphology of the Pd-Cu/activated carbon felt would be beneficial for field application compared to the conventional catalyst with powder form. © The Author(s) 2020.","activated carbon felt; bimetallic catalyst; Catalytic nitrate reduction; pH control; reverse osmosis concentrate","Activated alumina; Activated carbon; Aluminum oxide; Binary alloys; Catalysts; Copper alloys; Felt; Felts; Nitrogen removal; Organic carbon; Palladium alloys; Reverse osmosis; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Activated carbon felt; Alumina-based catalysts; Biodegradable organic carbon; Catalytic nitrate reductions; Conventional catalyst; Heterotrophic denitrification; Reverse osmosis concentrates; Total nitrogen removal; Nitrates; activated carbon; catalysis; catalyst; concentration (composition); copper; nitrate; palladium; pH; reduction; reverse osmosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084800132

By adjusting the amount of oleylamine added to the sol solution, we simultaneously developed N-doped carbon-embedded NiO films with an optimized surface pore structure. NiO films fabricated using 2.5 wt% oleylamine (2.5OL-NiO) exhibited superior EC energy-storage performance outcomes, specifically with regard to the switching speed (coloration speed of 3.2 s and bleaching speed of 2.7 s), coloration efficiency (CE) value (48.5 cm2/C), and the specific capacitance (235.8 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g). These attractive EC energy-storage performance outcomes are primarily due to the enhanced electrochemical activity with the optimized surface pore structure. This porous film morphology was developed using evaporated H2O molecules generated from an amide condensation reaction. A second cause was the improved electrical conductivity due to the highly conductive N-doped carbon formed by means of multimeric amide condensation, which provides preferred electron pathways.

It derives local reduction or increase of yield strength within the thickness of steel pipes by the plastic hardening and Bauschinger effect. In this study, a combined hardening model is proposed to effectively predict variations of yield strength in the circumferential direction of API-X65 and X70 steel pipes with relatively low t/D ratio during the forming process, which is expected to experience accumulated plastic strain of 2~3%, the typical Lüder band range in a low-carbon steel. Cyclic tensile tests of API-X65 and X70 steels were performed, and the parameters of the proposed model for the steels were calibrated using the test results. Bending-flattening tests to simulate repeated tension and compression during pipe forming were followed for API-X65 and X70 steels, and the results were compared with those by the proposed model and Zou et al. (2016), in order to verify the process of material model calibration based on tension-compression cyclic test, and the accuracy of the proposed model. Finally, parametric analysis for the yield strength of the steel plate in the circumferential direction of UOE pipe was conducted to investigate the effects of t/D and expansion ratios after O-forming on the yield strength. The results confirmed that the model by Zou et al.

For this purpose, there was a necessity for the study that could be tested to adjust the water unit quantity to ensure the constructability as well as the sustainability and performance assessment of concrete according to the quality characteristics of local raw materials. For a designed compressive strength (fck) of 24 MPa, which is commonly applied to 29-story apartment structures, the compressive strength properties of binary blended low-carbon concrete were investigated for replacement with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and fly ash (FA). The results of the study were as follows: The compressive strength at 28 days for 5 and 20 °C was linearly reduced by approximately 1.7 and 0.9 MPa when the replacement ratio of GGBS increased by 10% and by 2.5 and 3.8 MPa when the FA replacement ratio increased by 10%, respectively. For a mixing strength of 32.5 MPa at 28 days under 20 °C, the GGBS and FA replacement ratios were below 39.7% and 16.6%, respectively. In terms of environmental effect, when the GGBS and FA replacement ratio increased by 10% each, the life cycle environmental impact of GGBS decreased by 0.6 US$, while FA decreased by 1.1 US$.

Modelling tools are widely used to evaluate the ecological benefits of SCC in stormwater pollution mitigation. However, the understanding of the robustness of water quality modelling with different LID design options is still limited due to the paucity of water quality data as well as the high cost of water quality data collection and model calibration. This study develops a new concept of ‘robustness’ measured by model calibration performances. It combines an automatic calibration technique with intensive field monitoring data to perform the robustness analysis of storm water quality modelling using the SWMM (Storm Water Management Model). One of the national pilot areas of SCC, Fenghuang Cheng, in Shenzhen, China, is selected as the study area. Five water quality variables (COD, NH3-N, TN, TP, and SS) and 13 types of LID/non-LID infrastructures are simulated using 37 rainfall events. The results show that the model performance is satisfactory for different water quality variables and LID types. Water quality modelling of greenbelts and rain gardens has the best performance, while the models of barrels and green roofs are not as robust as those of the other LID types. In urban runoff, three water quality parameters, namely, SS, TN and COD, are better captured by the SWMM models than NH3-N and TP. The modelling performance tends to be better under heavy rain and significant pollutant concentrations, denoting a potentially more stable and reliable design of infrastructures. This study helps to improve the current understanding of the feasibility and robustness of using the SWMM model in sponge city design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE); Robustness analysis; Sponge city; Stormwater quality; SWMM","Ammonia; Pollution; Rain; Sewage; Storms; Water management; Water quality; Automatic calibration; Field monitoring data; Low impact development; Pollutant concentration; Storm water management model; Water quality modelling; Water quality parameters; Water quality variables; Quality control; ammonia; nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; storm water; design; hydrological modeling; infrastructural development; mitigation; performance assessment; runoff; stormwater; waste management; wastewater; water management; water quality; Article; calibration; chemical oxygen demand; China; controlled study; environmental monitoring; low impact development; priority journal; stormwater runoff; suspended particulate matter; water management; water pollutant; water quality; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090327036

Further, as an NP-complete problem, acceleration of SAT will also enable acceleration of a wide range of combinatorial problems. We propose a completely new custom hardware design to accelerate SAT. Starting with the well-known fact that Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP) takes most of the SAT solving time (80-90%), we focus on accelerating BCP. By profiling a widely-used software SAT solver, MiniSAT v2.2.0 (MiniSAT2) [1], we identify opportunities to accelerate BCP via parallelization and elimination of von Neumann overheads, especially data movement. The proposed hardware for BCP (HW-BCP) achieves these goals via a customized combination of content-addressable memory (CAM) cells, SRAM cells, logic circuitry, and optimized interconnects. In 65nm technology, on the largest SAT instances in the SAT Competition 2017 benchmark suite, our HW-BCP dramatically accelerates BCP (4.5ns per BCP in simulations) and hence provides a 62-185x speedup over optimized software implementation running on general purpose processors.

Therefore, in this study, we proposed a novel concept using directionally guided light transmission using double-sided asymmetric prism arrays for fabricating a privacy protection film for digital displays. The proposed film allows only the user in front of the display to see its contents using dual refraction in a prism array. Otherwise, when the display is viewed at an angle, it is difficult to recognize the contents due to the overlap of different letters. The optical path was analysed through ray-tracing simulations, and the performance of the film was quantified using an optical character recognition (OCR) method. To further enhance the effectiveness of the film, a metal film was applied on the vertical face of the micro prism arrays using an oblique deposition method. This metal-coated double-sided prism array film showed superior privacy-protecting performance compared to a conventional method based on the micro-louver structure. © 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",,"Data privacy; Light transmission; Metal coatings; Optical character recognition; Prisms; Conventional methods; Digital display; Micro prism array; Oblique deposition method; Optical character recognition (OCR); Privacy protecting; Privacy protection; Ray tracing simulation; Display devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100014230

Towards this end, experiments were conducted by setting the W/B ratio of liquid B to three different levels (100, 120, and 140%) and the replacement ratio at 50, 60, and 70%. The results showed that as the binder weight increases, the geltime of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and LCMs decreases, but the homogel strength tends to increase. In addition, it was found that as the binder weight increases by 100 kg/m3, the global warming potential (GWP) of OPC and LCMs shows a tendency to increase by 53.3 and 25.4 kg CO2 eq/m3, respectively. The optimal binder weight ranges of OPC and LCMs that satisfy both the target geltime (20–50 s) and the target homogel strength (2 MPa or higher, at 7 days) were found to be 227.7–470.4 and 182.9–432.3 kg/m3, respectively. The analysis also revealed that the GWP for each were 127.7–256.9 and 52.8–116.0 kg CO2 eq/m3, respectively. Therefore, it is expected that when the optimal binder weight range is applied to replace OPC with an LCM in the actual field, the GWP will be reduced by 74.9–140.9 kg CO2 eq/m3. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali-activated slag (AAS); Global warming potential (GWP); High CaO fly ash (HCFA); Low-carbon material (LCM); Sustainability performance","Calcium oxide; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact assessments; Fly ash; Global warming; Portland cement; Slags; Alkali activated slags; Engineering properties; Expected effects; Global warming potential; Mix designs; Ordinary Portland cement; Replacement ratio; Weight range; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092394533

However, the discovery of potent endolysin is still challenging because it is labor intensive and difficult to obtain a soluble form with high lytic activity. In this respect, the modular structures of Gram-positive endolysins can provide an opportunity to develop novel endolysins by domain rearrangement. In this study, a random domain swapping library of four different endolysins from phages infecting Staphylococcus aureus was constructed and screened to obtain engineered endolysins. The novel chimeric endolysin, Lys109 was selected and characterized for its staphylolytic activity. Lys109 exhibited greater bacterial cell lytic activity than its parental endolysins against staphylococcal planktonic cells and biofilms, showing highly improved activity in eliminating S. aureus from milk and on the surface of stainless steel.

Smart windows, which can use external signals to modulate their transparency, can regulate solar energy by reflecting excess energy and retaining the required energy in a building without using additional energy to cool or heat the interiors of the building. Although many technologies have been developed for smart windows, they still need to be economically optimised. Here, we propose a facile method to synthesise magnetic microrods from magnetic nanoparticles by alignment using a magnetic field. To maximise the transparency difference in the ON and OFF states, we controlled the nanoparticle concentration in a dispersion liquid, magnetic field application time, and viscosity of the dispersant. Interestingly, the magnetic microrods remained stable when we mixed short-chain polymers (polyethylene glycol) with a liquid dispersant (isopropyl alcohol). Furthermore, the Fe2O3 microrods maintained their shape for more than a week, while the Fe3O4 microrods clustered after a day because they became permanent magnets. The anisotropic features of the magnetic rods were used as a light valve to control the transparency of the smart window.

Although a few studies have reported the improved stability of OSCs that adopted Al-doped ZnO (AZO) as an electron transport layer (ETL), systematic research that validates the origins of this improvement has been lacking. In this work, we investigated the underlying mechanism for the improved stability of an OSC with AZO. By adopting AZO, the power conversion efficiency reached 8.65% and retained 70% of its initial value at 85 °C for 6 h, which was an increase in stability of 46% compared to that of an OSC with pristine ZnO. We found that the improved stability of the OSC with AZO originated from the decrease in oxygen defects and the space-charge limited current region through trap-related analyses and the Mott-Gurney law. Therefore, the results supported the enhanced thermal stability of OSCs that incorporated AZO as an ETL. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Aluminum compounds; Conversion efficiency; Electron transport properties; II-VI semiconductors; Oxide minerals; Stability; Thermodynamic stability; Zinc oxide; Critical issues; Electron transport layers; High temperature; Mott-Gurney law; Power conversion efficiencies; Space charge limited currents; Stable performance; Systematic research; Organic solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099497857

In order to apply this new material to prestressed concrete (PSC) structures, the material performance and characteristics have to be identified, while the conformity to the existing design criteria must also be variously evaluated and investigated. The study conducted a series of material performance evaluations to apply the newly developed 2360 MPa grade PS strand to a real structure. Firstly, the study evaluated the material properties of the 2360 MPa grade strand itself for all criteria; secondly, the evaluation of the bond performance between 2360 MPa grade strand and concrete; and thirdly, the performance of the anchorage system for 2360 MPa grade strand. As a result, the material performance, bond performance, and anchorage system performance for the 2360 MPa grade PS strand satisfied all specified performance criteria. Thereby the 2360 MPa grade strand could be applied directly to pre-tensioned and post-tensioned PSC structures. However, it was also found that the method of calculating the yield strength for the PS strand of ASTM A416 is unsuitable for higher strength PS strand than the 1860 MPa grade PS strand.

However, in respect of the presence or absence of the chorion, a consistent experimental methodology has yet to be developed. In this study, we used a fixed exposure scheme to compare the developmental toxicities of six major OPEs in chorionated and dechorionated zebrafish embryos. Removal of the chorion increased sensitivity to OPEs: we found higher incidence of mortality and malformation in dechorionated embryos. In a behavioral assay, the locomotive activity of zebrafish larvae was consistently inhibited by OPEs except tris (1-chloropropyl) phosphate regardless of chorion presence. However, at the molecular level, the expression of ZHE1 and mmp9 was affected by the presence of the chorion in zebrafish embryos exposed to tributyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), respectively. Furthermore, in zebrafish embryos exposed to TPHP, the increased expression of miR-137 and miR-141 was abolished by the presence of the chorion. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the presence of the chorion influences phenotypic morbidity, organismal behavior, and gene expression in zebrafish embryos exposed to chemicals; thus, we suggest that dechorionation is desirable for exploring the toxicity mechanisms that underlie effects of chemical exposure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chorion; Developmental toxicity; miRNAs; Neurotoxicity; OPEs; Zebrafish","Esters; Gene expression; Indicators (chemical); Chemical exposure; Developmental toxicity; Experimental methodology; Organophosphate esters; Toxicity mechanisms; Tri-butyl phosphate; Triphenyl phosphate; Zebrafish embryos; Toxicity; ester derivative; gelatinase B; igf1b protein; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 137; microRNA 141; organophosphate; transcription factor Sox9; transcription factor Sox9b; tributyl phosphate; triphenyl phosphate; tris (1 chloropropyl) phosphate; tris (1,3 dichloro 2 propyl) phosphate; tris (2 butoxyethyl) phosphate; tris (2 chloroethyl) phosphate; unclassified drug; zebrafish protein; zhe1 protein; ester; flame retardant; organophosphate; bioaccumulation; cyprinid; ecotoxicology; embryonic development; gene expression; morbidity; mortality; organophosphorus pesticide; pesticide residue; phenotype; phosphate; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; chorion; congenital malformation; controlled study; developmental toxicity; embryo; embryo (anatomy); embryotoxicity; hypoactivity; larva; locomotion; mortality; mRNA expression level; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; zebra fish; animal; chorion; Danio rerio; Animals; Chorion; Esters; Flame Retardants; Larva; Organophosphates; Zebrafish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088645126

In the single contract, a residential high-voltage rate is applied to the total electrical energy consumptions of households and common areas. On the other hand, in the general contract, different rate plans are applied to the electrical energy consumptions of households and their common areas, where a generic high-voltage rate plan is applied to the common consumption. Hence, depending on the amounts and composition of the consumptions, both contracts have their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of the total electricity charge. The management office of an apartment complex can select its preferred contract considering the amount and composition of the power consumptions on an annual basis. In this paper, we first formulate a model for the contracts and analyze their properties based on Monte-Carlo simulations. We then observe the contract properties through actual metering data from 30 apartment complexes in Korea. From the analysis of this paper, we can select appropriate contract for a given apartment complex and have guidelines for saving electricity charges. The greater the consumption of the electrical energy and the common area portion, the more advantageous the general contract is in terms of reducing electricity charges. © 2021 by the authors.

Besides, affordable high-temperature sensible heat thermal energy storage (SHTES) is required. In this work, the temperature distribution and thermal performance of novel solid media for SHTES are investigated by finite element method (FEM) modelling. A geopolymer, with/without fibre reinforcement, is simulated during a transient charging/discharging cycle. A life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis is also carried out to investigate the environmental impact and sustainability of the proposed materials, analysing the embodied energy, the transport, and the production process. A Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach, taking into account thermal/environmental performance, is used to select the most suitable material. The results show that the localized reinforcement with fibres increases thermal storage performance, depending on the type of fibre, creating curvatures in the temperature profile and accelerating the charge/discharge. High-strength, high-conductivity carbon fibres performed well, and the simulation approach can be applied to any fibre arrangement/material. On the con-trary, the benefit of the fibres is not straightforward according to the three different scenarios developed for the LCA and MCDM analyses, due to the high impact of the fibre production processes. More investigations are needed to balance and optimize the coupling of the fibre material and the solid medium to obtain high thermal performance and low impacts. © 2021 by the authors.

Among the various factors that influence the measurement of nonlinear parameters, maintaining a constant contact pressure between the receiver and specimen is important for repeatability of the measurement. The use of an air-coupled transducer may be considered to replace the contact receiver. In this paper, a method of measuring the relative and absolute nonlinear parameters of materials is described using an air-coupled transducer as a receiver. The diffraction and attenuation corrections are newly derived from an acoustic model for a two-layer medium and the nonlinear parameter formula with all corrections is defined. Then, we show that the ratio of the relative nonlinear parameter of the target sample to the reference sample is equal to that of the absolute nonlinear parameter, and this equivalence is confirmed by measurements on three systems of aluminum samples. The proposed method allows the absolute measurement of the nonlinear parameter ratio or the nonlinear parameter without calibration of the air-coupled receiver and removes restrictions on the selection of reference samples. © 2021 by the authors.

A third party password metering service may worsen this threat. In this paper, we first explore a new on-line password meter concept that does not necessitate the exposure of user’s passwords for evaluating user-chosen password candidates in the server side. Our basic idea is straightforward; to adapt fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes to build such a system but its performance achievement is greatly challenging. Optimization techniques are necessary for performance achievement in practice. We employ various performance enhancement techniques and implement the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) metering method as seminal work in this field. Our experiment results demonstrate that the running time of the proposed meter is around 60 s in a conventional desktop server, expecting better performance in high-end hardware, with an FHE scheme in HElib library where parameters support at least 80-bit security. We believe the proposed method can be further explored and used for a password metering in case that password secrecy is very important—the user’s password candidates should not be exposed to the meter and also an internal mechanism of password metering should not be disclosed to users and any other third parties. © 2021 by the authors.

The regular octahedron of the UiO-66 individual nanoparticle remained intact, and the micropore size did not change with increasing PVA addition without which the nanoporous UiO-66 could not granulate into beads. However, PVA bound the nanoparticles together to form compact and cohesive network clusters that reduced the BET surface area and total pore volume.

However, because these models are generally developed to detect objects in class units (e.g., person, car), additional training processes with numerous datasets are required to find a specific object. This paper proposes a model that accurately detects specific persons by using top clothing color information without any additional training processes. The proposed method combines CNN-based instance segmentation and pose estimation, utilizing all the advantages of each technique.

For this class of catalysts, efforts have been devoted to understand how variations in the active site or support composition influence catalytic properties. Here, we examine the influence of phosphonic acid functionalization of γ-Al2O3 surrounding atomically dispersed Rh active sites on their chemical and catalytic reactivity. It was observed that support functionalization modifies the activation entropies of elementary steps (CO desorption) and catalytic cycles (ethylene hydroformylation) on atomically dispersed Rh sites, with minimal influence on reaction enthalpies. Changes in activation entropy were attributed to support functionalization causing a decrease in the translational degrees of freedom associated with mobile atomically dispersed Rh(CO)2 species on the γ-Al2O3 support. Changes to the activation entropies on functionalized catalysts caused increases in turn over frequencies and selectivity for ethylene hydroformylation in gas phase steady state conditions. The observed breaking of enthalpy–entropy compensation suggests that support functionalization may enable tuning of catalytic reactivity beyond the confines of linear free relationships for catalysts consisting of mobile active sites. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,"Activated alumina; Aliphatic compounds; Aluminum oxide; Catalysis; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical activation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Enthalpy; Entropy; Ethylene; Hydroformylation; Rhodium compounds; Transition metals; Activation entropies; Catalytic properties; Catalytic reactivity; Entropy compensation; Ethylene hydroformylation; Late-transition metal catalysts; Steady-state condition; Translational degrees of freedoms; Catalyst activity",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114596170

The photocatalytic activity of 1.5 at% Ag-ZnO nanofibers toward RhB degradation was the greatest, outperforming pure ZnO nanofiber by a factor of more than 5 times. Further increasing the Ag content led to lower photocatalytic activity, most likely due to the growth of the Ag nanoparticles. It was found that the enhanced photocatalytic activity is caused by the heterojunction structure promoting the charge separation of the photogenerated charge carriers, while the effect of surface plasmon resonance by the Ag nanoparticles on the photoreactivity is insufficient.

To this purpose, we have extended the original SLIC algorithm to use the operations in Apache Spark, supporting its parallel processing on multiple executors in the Apache Spark cluster. Then, we analyze the trade-off relationship of PSLIC-on-Spark between its processing speed and accuracy due to partitioning of the original image datasets. Through experiments, we verify the trade-off relationship. Specifically, we show that PSLIC-on-Spark using 8 CPU cores reduces the processing time of SLIC by 2.24–2.93 times while it reduces the boundary recall (BR) of SLIC by 1.54–6.32% and increases under-segmentation error (UE) by 1.79–6.2%. Then, we propose an improved algorithm of PSLIC-on-Spark that improves the accuracy of PSLIC-on-Spark, which we call PASLIC-on-Spark. We employ two important features for PASLIC-on-Spark. It contains two main features: (1) image partitioning considering the shape and position of the clusters rather than a evenly partitioning method and (2) controllable duplication for the boundary between image partitions.

Its purpose is to improve organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems’ performance. The ORC systems require a higher pressure ratio across the turbine to generate higher power output. It leads some designs to suffer from a choking condition by the higher pressure ratio. A choked flow leads to saturation of the mass flow rate and power, and a supersonic turbine can be an alternative to this problem. We use the meanline analysis, the method of characteristics, case studies, and validation of the 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations to design the supersonic turbine. 3D CFD is used to simulate the performance of the designed turbine. This approach allows us to understand its aerodynamic characteristics, performance in off-design conditions and also to find the recommended operating conditions. For validation of the numerical model, a comparison was carried out using previous literature that utilized supersonic flow with an organic fluid. The compared results are consistent, validating our numerical model. The designed supersonic turbine has 18 blades for the nozzle and 61 blades for the rotor.

Two sets of specimens with top surfaces consisting of triangular peaks and valleys were modeled and 3D-Printed by varying the height of the peak, the depth of the valley, and the width between two intersections of the peak or valley with the center line. For one set of specimens, values of these variables were kept constant within a specimen but varied across specimens. For the other set of specimens, values of these variables were randomly selected in given ranges within a specimen while ranges were varied across specimens. The level of touch perception of each specimen was then measured using a questionnaire consisting of 16 adjectives related to touch perception and a 7-point Likert scale. Measured data were statistically analyzed and compared between different sets of specimens. Results indicated that it was inappropriate to directly apply findings of the previous studies for surfaces with regularly spaced, geometrically well-defined features to surfaces with randomly spaced, irregular features.

This study aimed to examine heterogeneity in Medicare enrollment across the six largest subgroups of Asian Americans (Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Indian, Korean, and Vietnamese), in relation to their citizenship status and labor force participation. Methods: Data from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (2014–2018) were analyzed for older foreign-born Asians aged 65 or older (N = 83,378). A two-level multilevel logistic regression model (states > individuals) was used to model the probabilities of Medicare enrollment, accounting for state-level residential clustering by Asian subgroup and, thus, for nonindependence among respondents from the same state. Results: The results indicated a substantial amount of heterogeneity in Medicare enrollment across the six Asian subgroups. Although the overall Medicare enrollment rate was low (90.2%), the rates varied from 85.5% among Indians to 93.8% among Koreans and Japanese. Naturalized citizens and those not in the labor force were associated with greater probabilities of Medicare enrollment. However, the relative differences in the Medicare enrollment rates across the six Asian subgroups were different by individuals’ naturalization status and labor force participation (i.e., significant three-way interactions). Discussion: These results highlight that aggregated data cannot accurately represent Medicare and health insurance status of older Asians with different sub-ethnic backgrounds. Intragroup and intergroup differences in Medicare enrollment among foreign-born older Asians should be considered for targeted policy approaches for this group of older adults. © 2021, W.

The study uses the monthly full reanalysis precipitation product version 6 of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre and the maximum and minimum temperature CRU version TS v. 3.23 products of the Climatic Research Unit as reference data. The study applied five statistical indices, namely, normalized root mean square error, percentage of bias, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, coefficient of determination, and volumetric efficiency. Compromise programming (CP) was then used in the aggregation of the scores of the different GCMs for the variables. Spatial assessment, probability distribution function, Taylor diagram, and mean monthly assessments were used in confirming the findings from the CP. The study revealed that CP was able to uniformly evaluate the GCMs even though there were some contradictory results in the statistical indicators. Spatial assessment of the GCMs in relation to the observed showed the highest ranked GCMs by the CP were able to better reproduce the observed properties. The least ranking GCMs were observed to have both spatially overestimated or underestimated precipitation and temperature over the study area. In combination with the other measures, the GCMs were ranked using the final scores from the CP. IPSL-CM6A-LR, NESM3, CMCC-CM2-SR5, and ACCESS-ESM1-5 were the highest ranking GCMs for precipitation. For maximum temperature, INM.CM4-8, BCC-CSM2-MR, MRI-ESM2-0, and ACCESS-ESM1-5 ranked the highest, while AWI-CM-1–1-MR, IPSL-CM6A-LR, INM.CM5-0, and CanESM5 ranked the highest for minimum temperature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113388754

In the proposed framework, the user can provide reliable biometric features of body channel responses (BCRs) simply by touching an electrode surface on the device with a finger. To realize and verify the proposed approach, we acquired the BCR data from 15 subjects for approximately six weeks through experiments conducted in a customized measurement setup suited to the principle of signal transmission in the human body channel. The proposed BCR-based biometric feature (BBF) comprises a series of envelope vectors of the received BCR when applying up- and down-chirp signals to the human body, which is extracted by an interpolative method based on peak detection. The BBFs are effectively separable according to the subjects because the features magnify quantitative differences in the aspect of path losses and power delay profiles of individual BCRs for the frequency range between 1 and MHz. The classification performance was evaluated by splitting the dataset into {80\%} and 20% for the training and testing, respectively, using conventional machine learning algorithms with uncorrelated 40 session datasets for the respective subjects. The highest average classification accuracy was achieved by the kernel-based support vector machine approximately 95.8% without observable and biased misidentification cases among the subjects.

Getting new information and sharing it with others has become much easier with social multimedia. To boost the productivity and growth of any university, student contentment is a critical factor. Student contentment level is the need of the hour that is necessitated to be analyzed every year for the progress of the university. In this paper, we use a social multimedia technique to collect data from the students of the university based on a designed questionnaire circulated. The collected information embraces different aspects like academics, research, recreational, and technology that portray the image of the university. The current work relies on developing a stacking ensemble machine learning model for prediction of student’s overall contentment score, an indicator to perceive overall, how much the university gets the thumbs up from its current students. The work employs the cuckoo search meta-heuristic based wrapper method for feature selection from the original dataset with 78 features. The proposed ensemble model portrayed a lowest RMSE value of 0.373 by the combination of Self Organizing Map, Multilayer Perceptron, Boosted Generalized Linear Model and Gaussian Process with Polynomial Kernel along with Partial Least Squares as meta-learner, showcasing its ability to accurately predict student contentment levels of a University.

The stress hormones (cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine) in blood sample of pigs reared in the housing rooms with or without air cleaner have been measured according to a pig's rearing stage: 0 day (farrowing), 21st day (farrowing-weaning), 70th day (weaning-nursery), 140th day (nursery-growing), and 180th day (growing-fattening). The comparison of pork quality according to the application of an air cleaner was performed through the carcass analysis of the pigs shipped from swine house. The levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in pigs reared in housing rooms with and without air cleaners were found to be within the range of normal reference values. Among pork quality evaluation items, the thickness of intermuscular fat and final carcass grade of pigs raised in housing room with air cleaner was generally superior to those of pigs raised in housing room without air cleaner (p < 0.05). Based on the results obtained from this study, it is concluded that air cleaner does not have a significant effect on reducing pig stress but contributes to improving pork quality in pig breeding.

This study discusses why robot accidents resulting in harm to operators occur repetitively despite implementing control measures and proposes corrective actions for risk assessments. Methods: This study collected 369 operator-injured robot accidents in Korea over the last decade and reconstructed them into the mechanism of injury, work being undertaken, and bodily location of the injury. Then, through the techniques of Systematic Cause Analysis Technique (SCAT) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA), this study analyzed the root and direct causes of robot accidents that had occurred. Causes identified included physical hazards and complex combinations of hazards, such as psychological, organizational, and systematic errors. The requirements of risk assessments regarding robot operations were examined, and three case studies of robot-involved tasks were investigated. The three assessments presented were: camera module processing, electrical discharge machining, and a panel-flipping robot installation. Results: After conducting RCA and comparing the three assessments, it was found that two-thirds of injury-occurring from robot accidents, causative factors included psychological and personal traits of robot operators. However, there were no evaluations of the identifications of personal aspects in the three assessment cases. Conclusion: Therefore, it was concluded that personal factors of operators, which had been overlooked in risk assessments so far, need to be included in future risk assessments on robot operations. © 2021 The Authors","Human factor; Human-robot collaboration; Psychology; Risk assessment; Root cause analysis",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113315492

Through testbed experiments, we observe that frequency shift is effective in mitigating the impact of the inherent fluctuation of WiFi signals, particularly in bistate backscatter communication; however, due to the weak strength of the backscattered signal, other signals from incumbent transmitters may appear in the shifted frequency channels, significantly interfering with the backscattered signal. To combat this challenge in a way that is nondisruptive to incumbent transmitters, we propose a receiver-side spectro-temporal combining scheme in which spectrum combining is performed to suppress interference appearing in one of the shifted channels, while temporal combining is performed with transmission repetitions to suppress bit errors resulting from residual interference. The scheme's on-the-fly spectrum combining and bit-sequence temporal combining require minimal buffer memory. Through system prototyping and testbed experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional and temporal-combining-only cases in terms of the bit error rate and throughput under various conditions. © 2013 IEEE.","Ambient backscatter communication; frequency shift; interference suppression; ultralow-power communication; WiFi backscatter","Backscattering; Bit error rate; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Testbeds; Transmitters; Backscattered signal; Carrier signals; Combining schemes; Communication range; Frequency channels; Residual interference; Shifted frequencies; System prototyping; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113306295

However, the 2D clothing shape transform methods in the earlier works show serious limitations in 3D clothing deformation required in multiple-pose VTON scenarios. In this paper, we develop a 3D-MPVTON system of two pipelines and show that a 3D clothing model reconstruction approach provides much better results for the multi-pose VTON scenario. First, the 3D clothing model reconstruction pipeline is based on CloTH-VTON+. The try-on clothing is matched to the target clothing regions in the simply-shaped reference human model and its 3D model is reconstructed using the associated 3D human body model. For natural clothing rendering from an arbitrary view, accurate texture mapping is crucial. We have developed a highly accurate texture matching method. The try-on pipeline first generates target segmentation from the target pose for conditional information for the following stage's network models. Correct target segmentation was one of the main performance bottlenecks in previous VTON studies. Our proposed equalized entropy loss for the target segmentation generation network greatly reduces the segmentation label imbalance, and results in high-quality segmentation and reduced training time. The rigged reconstructed 3D clothing model can be easily deformed into the target pose and the human body shape while retaining the textures of the clothes. The remaining parts, i.e., the non-target clothing regions of the human in the target pose are generated through a deep generative human pose transfer model.

For fabricating H-CoNCs, a facile spray pyrolysis-assisted process is used, and such produced H-CoNCs show a porous and hollow-shell structure, while they include a large amount of isolated Co atoms and coordinate bonds with Co and nitrogen (Co-N4). This structure promotes mass transfer to the active site and excellent catalytic activity for HPOR. With these benefits of H-CoNCs, the current density of the bioanode consisting of H-CoNC, carbon nanotube, and glucose oxidase (H-CoNC/CNT/GOx) observed at 0.3 V under 150 mM glucose is 315.5 μA cm−2, which is 2.1 times higher than that of a conventionally synthesized catalyst using Co-doped carbon nanoparticles (CoNC-NPs) (CoNC-NPs/CNT/GOx, 146.2 μA cm−2). With this superior catalytic activity for HPOR, maximum power density (MPD) of membraneless EBC using H-CoNC/CNT/GOx is 33.8 ± 4.52 μW cm−2, which is 52% higher than that of CoNP-NPs/CNT/GOx. In addition, a membraneless HPFC using H-CoNC/CNT demonstrates 4.87 times higher MPD (231.3 ± 11.3 μW cm−2) than that using CoNC-NPs/CNT, proving that H-CoNC improves the performance of fuel cells by its excellent catalytic activity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","cobalt-doped carbon; enzymatic biofuel cell; hydrogen peroxide fuel cell; hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction; single-atomic catalyst","Anodic oxidation; Biofuels; Carbon nanotubes; Cobalt; Doping (additives); Enzymatic fuel cells; Glucose; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensors; Hydrogen peroxide; Mass transfer; Nitrogen; Peroxides; Spray pyrolysis; Synthesis (chemical); Coordinate bonds; Hollow shells; Hydrogen peroxide fuel cells; Hydrogen peroxide oxidations; Maximum power density; Membraneless fuel cell; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Performance enhancements; Catalyst activity",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113291829

A simple solution is to separate interfering network nodes into orthogonal channels to reduce the interference among them. However, determining the optimal channel assignment is considered to be a non-linear problem, which may also be associated with practical implementation issues such as high computational complexity and control signaling issues. In an effort to cope with these challenging issues, we propose a distributed channel assignment algorithm that efficiently finds the optimal channel configuration by utilizing the concept of belief propagation. Based on a message-passing framework, the proposed distributed channel assignment algorithm maximizes the overall sum rate of the ultra-dense network with a low computational load for each network node. In addition, we design a network protocol and frame format to implement the proposed message-passing framework to real-world wireless networks. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that network nodes autonomously determine the optimal channel assignment and rapidly adapt to dynamic changes of the network. Simulation results confirm that the proposed distributed channel assignment algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of various network performance aspects, such as the sum rate, scalability, latency, and user mobility.

The main challenge presented by this asymmetric topology is interstation interference from the uplink-transmitting station to the downlink-receiving station. In this paper, we develop a novel medium access control (MAC) protocol and an associated station selection algorithm that exploit successive interference cancellation (SIC) to resolve the interstation interference. To understand the problem and find design rationales, we establish concepts of distinct transmission types and conduct a formal analysis of decodability with SIC, based on which we show that a transmission-type-specific design is necessary due to the type-dependent information requirements and asymmetric availability of information. We define, identify, and illustrate the SIC-eligible, interference and noninterference regions, each of which has different decodability characteristics. The developed MAC protocol is designed to guarantee coexistence with legacy wireless LANs. The developed station selection algorithm is designed to handle all possible transmission cases of full-duplex communication in both the centralized and distributed operation modes, which differ in terms of the signaling overhead and achieved performance; moreover, this algorithm can be combined with a wide range of access point schedulers. Through comprehensive simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme considerably enhances the system and per-station throughputs compared with conventional schemes, approaching the ideal case with no interstation interference.

This article presents a comprehensive study for a highly reliable HBC system, including body channel modeling, transceiver design, and performance evaluation through implementation, in consideration of practical sensor network environments for wearable and implantable devices applicable to healthcare and biosignal acquisition. Body channel characteristics based on capacitive couplings, such as root mean square delay spread and mean path gain (MPG), were explored by measuring the body impulse responses under 12 experimental conditions, determined by the variation in body postures and device locations between the wrist and positions assumed under the scalp through a customized experimental setup with micropig-derived biomembranes (MBMs) used for wrapping the devices to emulate an implantable environment. The proposed transceiver design for digital transmission, including a preamble structure and signal modulation method supporting a maximum data rate of 1 Mb/s, was verified through the performance evaluations conducted for examining the frame detection probability and bit error rate (BER) in the body channel model at multiple operating frequencies of 32, 42, and 64 MHz. The proposed system reliability was demonstrated by the achievement of a BER of below 4.7,×, 10-8 through battery-powered implemented devices with dimensions of 30× 30, mm2, comprising a digital signal processing module (DSPM) for signal generation and detection processes, and an analog front-end module (AFEM) for recovering the received signal from signal deterioration by severe path loss and time-dispersive effect in the body channel. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Body channel model; human body communications (HBCs); implantable device; sensor networks; wearable device; wireless body area network (WBAN)","Bit error rate; Deterioration; Digital signal processing; Implants (surgical); Sensor networks; Transceivers; Capacitive couplings; Digital transmission; Electric signal transmission; Experimental conditions; Human body communications; Root mean square delay spreads; Sensor network environment; Signal deterioration; Digital devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113236966

Especially, spatial patterns of defective chips, e.g. zone, scratch, ring patterns, etc. presented on a wafer map provide valuable information on the potential causes of malfunctions in a fabrication process. Numerous automatic analysis methods have been developed for identifying such defect patterns. We propose a defect pattern analysis method based on density-based clustering (DBC), which consists of two steps: conducting a statistical test to detect wafer maps that contain abnormal defects and clustering the defect patterns. Specifically, we develop a new statistic based on the core points from DBC for the spatial randomness test, which requires much fewer examinations to identify abnormal wafer maps than the existing joint-count based statistics. With those core points, clustering of abnormal defects can be coherently performed in the subsequent clustering step. The main advantage of our method over previous automatic detection methods is that it performs both steps simultaneously based on the core points from DBC. The proposed method is evaluated on simulated and real wafer map datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method identifies spatial dependence among defects as accurate as the existing methods, but with much less computational effort. © 2013 IEEE.","defect patterns; density-based clustering; spatial randomness test; Wafer map analysis","Defects; Semiconductor device manufacture; Automatic analysis method; Automatic detection method; Computational effort; Density-based Clustering; Fabrication process; Semiconductor manufacturing; Spatial dependence; Yield enhancement; Silicon wafers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113194365

In order for uninterruptible power supply to the local load, it should be seamless to change from GC mode to SA mode. This carries two type of issues. One is a transient state caused by switching the control loops. The other is an uncontrolled state during the time interval between a grid failure and its detection, called clearing time. These can lead to unstable voltage for the local load. Hence, a smooth and autonomous mode switching method is required even if the fault detection is late. Existing mode transfer methods considering both the issues have been accompanied by a slow dynamic response, additional sensors, restriction of adopting filter or controller complexity due to 3rd order plant.

Scholars argue that political trust influences more strongly individuals who perceive a given policy to be one that imposes ideological risks for them compared with those without such risks. Focusing on the moderating role of political trust, the article examines whether political trust can help alleviate the conservatives’ hostility to the arts.

A full-state estimator and a grid voltage observer are designed to reduce the number of sensors. A lumped disturbance observer, considering the parameter mismatch along with the grid impedance variation, is also designed to eliminate the steady-state error. A cost function, which consists of the error state and control input, is employed in the MPC design. Based on the Lyapunov stability, the full-state observer, voltage estimation, lumped disturbance observer, and the robust controller gains are obtained by solving an optimization problem based on linear matrix inequality (LMI). A frequency response analysis of the entire system is conducted to verify the reference tracking and disturbance rejection outcomes. As a result, the state and grid voltage observer outcomes converge to the actual values as rapidly as possible. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated in comparison with the proportional-integral (PI) approach and with a controller recently proposed in the literature.

While the demand for an efficient video stitching algorithm for generating immersive videos has increased, it has received limited attention in the literature. Furthermore, stitched videos often suffer from distorted objects, temporal inconsistency and time constraints. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient seam finding algorithm that preserves objects from distortion, minimizes temporal inconsistency, and reduces processing time. One of the fundamental steps in image and video stitching is the estimation of seam boundary. To do this, the proposed algorithm leverages a convolutional neural networks-based instance segmentation algorithm that provides more accurate object regions. It computes energy surfaces considering the regions and then estimates seam boundary by discovering a minimal energy path with minimal computations. We validate the proposed algorithm using real-world high-resolution 360-degree sequences. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can produce seam boundaries that avoid objects with better temporary consistency. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of pixels passed through objects by approximately 30% on average compared to the existing algorithms. The qualitative comparisons furthermore demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently produces more perceptually pleasing results. © 2013 IEEE.","360-degree video; deep neural network; image stitching; instance segmentation; seam estimation; Video stitching","Convolutional neural networks; Cutting algorithm; Finding algorithm; High resolution; Limited attentions; Segmentation algorithms; Temporal inconsistencies; Time constraints; Video stitching; Image segmentation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112157259

To do this, new rGO with three-dimensional open porous structure is formed by spray freeze drying method (sprGO), while tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) as mediator, and GOx are sequentially immobilized onto sprGO. To improve the loading amount of catalyst, rGO structure is modified to open porous sprGO structure possessing numerous anchoring sites, after which gelatin film crosslinked by glutaraldehyde is fabricated onto sprGO to prevent any losses of other components (sprGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin). Specific surface area and charge transfer resistance of sprGO are quantitatively measured, and the actual amount of immobilized GOx and the performance of EBFC using this catalyst are electrochemically examined. With this, it is found that the amount of GOx immobilized in sprGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin is twice better that in rGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin. More specifically, EBFC using this catalyst shows open circuit voltage of 0.85 V and maximum power density of 380 μW/cm2, and this is 1.4 times better than that using rGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin. These results indicate that the amount of immobilized GOx strongly affects the performance capabilities of EBFCs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biofuel cell; freeze-drying method; glucose oxidase; open porous structure; spray frozen reduced graphene oxide","Biofuels; Catalysts; Charge transfer; Enzymatic fuel cells; Enzyme immobilization; Glucose; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensors; Graphene; Open circuit voltage; Charge transfer resistance; Glucose biofuel cells; Glucose oxidases (GOx); Maximum power density; Modification process; Performance capability; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Structural modifications; Reduced Graphene Oxide",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111918169

This work reports a novel bioinspired conjugate with polysaccharide (alginate)–tannic acid (TA)–protein (bovine serum albumin) to fabricate proteoglycan-like gels, which are 3D printable with multilayers, shear-thinning, elastic, electroconductive (with carbon nanotubes), controlled crosslinking/degradation through multiple crosslinking mechanisms (TA, Ca2+ ions, and NaIO4 oxidation), and interactions with cytocompatible hydrogel system. The synthesis process is simple, and gelation (within 2 h) is ensured without any chemical crosslinking agents (at room temperature). While cell-adhesive albumin largely improves cytocompatibility, carbon nanotubes in the gel give electrical conductivity in the different four-axis 3D printed structures, including large hollow tubular constructs. This work demonstrates promising results of electroconductive proteoglycan-like gel ink to address the challenges in 3D/four-axis ink printing such as synthesis, printability, shape fidelity, electroconductivity, controlled fabrication and degradation, cytocompatibility, and multiple crosslinking abilities to maintain the dimensions of the diversely printed constructs. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","alginate; biomaterial inks; bovine serum albumin; four-axis printing; tannic acid","Adhesives; Alginate; Calcium compounds; Carbon nanotubes; Crosslinking; Electric conductivity; Gelation; Hydrogels; Iodine compounds; Mammals; Non Newtonian flow; Shear flow; Shear thinning; Sodium compounds; Bio-functionalities; Bovine serum albumins; Chemical cross-linking; Electrical conductivity; Electroconductivity; Multiple crosslinking; Printable hydrogels; Supporting material; 3D printers",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111894859

A self-adaptive motion predictor was used to predict the probabilistic future states of vehicles and estimate the uncertainty of prediction simultaneously. Then, a free space boundary and drivable corridor were defined to determine the desired longitudinal acceleration and path. Based on these two boundary definitions, the proposed proactive motion planner decided the desired longitudinal motion by considering the risk potential of objects, such as the appearance of vulnerable road users from the free space boundary. The desired path is determined within the drivable corridor by the proposed motion planner with an integrated motion optimizer. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been validated via vehicle tests. The test results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm proactively determined lateral and longitudinal motion to minimize risks caused by detected and possible objects simultaneously on complex narrow roads to ensure safety. © 2013 IEEE.","Autonomous driving; model predictive control; prediction uncertainty estimator; proactive motion planning; self-adaptive motion prediction; vehicle safety","Automobile testing; Autonomous vehicles; Forecasting; Motion planning; Object detection; Uncertainty analysis; Urban planning; Adaptive motion; Autonomous driving; Boundary definition; Longitudinal acceleration; Longitudinal motion; Moving vehicles; Potential risks; Urban environments; Motion estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111582811

As yarn connection paths and the initial positions of the yarn feeders vary the production time and costs, they, at their optimums, could reduce labor and material costs and production time respectively. This study thus sought to optimize yarn connection paths and the initial yarn feeders’ positions using two genetic algorithms (GA), which were subsequently applied to a sample sweater design.

The use of power assist electric bicycles (e-bikes) has been shown to be a good exercise option since it allows older adults to adjust the degree of physical activity while maintaining higher levels of enjoyment compared to riding conventional bicycles. However, their use may present a fall risk to older adults due to their inherent instability and it is difficult to determine suitable power assistance from motor. We seek to solve this problem by using an electric trike (e-trike) instead of an e-bike and propose two novel power assistance algorithms to determine the assistive torque for our developed e-trike. Inverse dynamics calculations using pedal force, pedal angle, and crank angle are performed for effective assistance. The first algorithm is aimed at older adults with weak lower body muscle strength by analyzing the rear wheel torque, and the second is a joint assistive algorithm that reduces the physical effort for a specific leg joint (hip, knee, or ankle), for those who have joint problems, based on inverse dynamics. Finally, in a controlled environment, an experimental validation successfully verified the performance of the power assistance algorithms. Muscle activity in each test method is also presented using electromyography (EMG) to demonstrate the assistive performance of the muscles. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","E-trike; Inverse dynamics; Older adults; Power assistance","Agricultural robots; Bicycles; Dynamics; Electric bikes; Joints (anatomy); Muscle; Sporting goods; Testing; Controlled environment; Electric bicycles; Experimental validations; Inherent instability; Muscle activities; Physical activity; Power assistance; Successful aging; Inverse problems",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110931571

Since the oxidative aging of asphalt is a complex chemical process, it is difficult to define the asphalt aging as a function of limited variables. When comparing the same types of asphalt mixes, however, the mix temperature (T) and time (t) kept at the T will be the primary source of variation affecting aging levels of the binder in the mix. Since the binder aging level is not easy to estimate without measuring a physical property, this study concentrated on developing an aging quantity (AQ) model for estimating aging levels of the binder in the mix based on T and t. The loose asphalt mixes were artificially short-term aged at various Ts for different t; 130, 160, and 180 °C for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. The absolute viscosity (AV) values, which represent aging levels of the recovered binder after each short-term aging (SA) of normal dense-graded mix, were used for regression with AQ values computed by the AQ model. The best-fit AQ model was selected by trial-and-error regression iterations between measured AV and computed AQ. The AQ was then used to estimate AV (EAV) of the aged asphalts in various normal asphalt mixes. It was found that the AQ was useful for estimating AV of the binder in the SA-treated mix, and the EAV by AQ showed an excellent correlation with the measured AV with R2 &gt; 0.99. Therefore, it was possible to conclude that the AQ could be used to predict aging level of various short-term-aged normal asphalt mixes if the materials sources were limited. © 2021, The Author(s).","Absolute viscosity (AV); Aging quantity (AQ) modeling; Asphalt; Regression; Short-term aging (SA)","Engineering; Industrial engineering; Aging temperatures; Asphalt aging; Complex chemicals; Hot mix asphalt; Oxidative aging; Primary sources; Time-periods; Trial and error; Asphalt mixtures",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110894385

An independent control method in one module is proposed to increase the efficiency of the converter compared to the conventional complementary control method. In the modular output-series connection, higher efficiency can be achieved by shedding needless modules in the low voltage range. Module shedding and activating techniques are proposed to eliminate current and voltage transients during a mode change under any load condition without the use of additional bypass switches. In addition, when a fault occurs in one module, its effect on the other module is analyzed. A practical solution involving turn-off processes for fail-safe operation is proposed, which reduces current stress and voltage spikes on devices and effect among modules without depending on the external signal from the central controller and the communication delay.

Since these two events, China has implemented strong regulations in the form of structural changes in financial markets and the application of accounting standards. The analysis results can be summarized as follows: first, the analysis of samples for all firm years showed that the expenses of t-1, t, and t+1 had significant positive effects on current revenue. In particular, as concluded by prior studies, the current (t) expenses had the greatest impact on current revenue. Second, before and after the 2008 financial crisis, this matching level changed, but was not statistically significant. However, prior to the 2008 financial crisis and after the 2015 stock price crash, prior and current expenses showed statistically significant coefficients with regard to current revenues. This study provides accounting policy implications as an analysis of the impact of changes in accounting policies due to macroeconomic events in China on the level of revenue–expense matching. © 2021 AESS Publications.

Ni-based oDS powder was prepared by high-energy ball milling of gas-atomized alloy powders and Y2o3 particles treated with a high-pressure homogenizer. Decrease in particle size and improvement of dispersion stability were observed by high-pressure homogenization of as-received Y2o3 particles, presumably by the powerful cavitation forces and by collisions of the particles. Microstructural analysis for the ball-milled powder mixtures reveal that Ni-based oDS powders prepared from high-pressure homogenization of Y2o3 particles exhibited more fine and uniform distribution of Ni and Y elements compared to the as-received powder. These results suggested that high-pressure homogenization process is useful for producing Ni-based superalloy with homogeneously dispersed oxide particles. © 2021. The Author(s).

The welding microstructures of the 347 stainless steel were simulated by subjecting the steel specimen to solution and aging treatments. undissolved NbC carbides were present within grains after solution treatment, and m23C6 carbides were preferentially formed at grain boundaries after subsequent aging treatment. The m23C6 carbides formed at grain boundaries worked as stress concentration sites and thus generated larger cracks during high-temperature tensile testing. In addition, grain boundary embrittlement was found to be a dominant mechanism for the high-temperature fracture of the 347 stainless steel because vacancy diffusion in the Cr-depleted zones enhances intergranular fracture due to the precipitation of m23C6 carbides at grain boundaries. © 2021.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl) for 2 h to induce release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thereafter, the cells were treated with the respective DSW samples before ROS concentrations, as well as antioxidant enzyme activity and protein levels, were measured. Among the water samples, HMLS showed the most protective effect against ROS, whereas the intracellular glutathione content was highest in cells from the HMLS-and HMHC-treated groups. However, TM- and HMHC-treated cells showed similar tendencies to the control group, in terms of mRNA expression of antioxidant genes. These results suggested that DSW may aid in preventing renal oxidative stress caused by excessive sodium intake. Furthermore, it was determined that HMLS and HMHC water samples displayed good antioxidant effects in the kidney cell model, based on the combined results of ROS concentration and antioxidant marker measurements. © 2021, Korean Society for Applied Biological Chemistry.

Even though there are several distributed spatial data processing systems such as GeoSpark (Apache Sedona), the effects of underlying storage engines have not been well studied for spatial data processing. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of various distributed storage engines for processing large-scale spatial data using GeoSpark, a state-of-the-art distributed spatial data processing system running on top of Apache Spark. For our performance evaluation, we choose three distributed storage engines having different characteristics: (1) HDFS, (2) MongoDB, and (3) Amazon S3. To conduct our experimental study on a real cloud computing environment, we utilize Amazon EMR instances (up to 6 instances) for distributed spatial data processing. For the evaluation of big spatial data processing, we generate data sets considering four kinds of various data distributions and various data sizes up to one billion point records (38.5GB raw size). Through the extensive experiments, we measure the processing time of storage engines with the following variations: (1) sharding strategies in MongoDB, (2) caching effects, (3) data distributions, (4) data set sizes, (5) the number of running executors and storage nodes, and (6) the selectivity of queries. The major points observed from the experiments are summarized as follows. (1) The overall performance of MongoDB-based GeoSpark is degraded compared to HDFS- and S3-based GeoSpark in our experimental settings. (2) The performance of MongoDB-based GeoSpark is relatively improved in large-scale data sets compared to the others. (3) HDFS- and S3-based GeoSpark are more scalable to running executors and storage nodes compared to MongoDB-based GeoSpark. (4) The sharding strategy based on the spatial proximity significantly improves the performance of MongoDB-based GeoSpark. (5) S3- and HDFS-based GeoSpark show similar performances in all the environmental settings. (6) Caching in distributed environments improves the overall performance of spatial data processing. These results can be usefully utilized in decision-making of choosing the most adequate storage engine for big spatial data processing in a target distributed environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Comparative study; Distributed storage engines; GeoSpark; Query performance; Spatial data","Data handling; Decision making; Engines; Virtual storage; Cloud computing environments; Data distribution; Distributed environments; Distributed storage; Large scale data sets; Spatial data processing; Spatial informations; Spatial proximity; Spatial distribution",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109099223

In actuality, there is no implicit tax phenomenon because this phenomenon occurs in a perfectly competitive market where there are no barriers to entry, transaction costs, or transaction friction. Since most Chinese companies are owned by the Chinese government and are not fully capitalist markets, the possibility of more implicit taxes is not expected to occur. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether the Chinese government’s ownership of enterprises and the global financial crisis have had an effect on the realization of the implicit tax phenomena. The results of this study are as follows. First, the pre-tax return on equity (PTROE) of listed Chinese companies had a statistically significant positive relationship with the pre-tax subsidy on equity (PTSE). Second, for companies with a higher level of Chinese government-owned interest, PTROE had a statistically significant positive relationship with PTSE; so this result shows that Chinese companies receive tax benefits, but an implicit tax in the market is not realized. Third, during the global financial crisis, the PTROE of Chinese companies showed an insignificant negative relationship with PTSE. In addition, companies owned by the Chinese government showed an insignificant negative relationship between PTROE and PTSE during the global financial crisis. This study provides policy implications that government ownership equity and macroeconomic events influence the level of freedom in a market economy. © Sung Man Yoon, Di Qu, 2021","Explicit tax; Global financial crisis; Government ownership; Implicit tax; Tax subsidy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109097352

Supporting an efficient hardware architecture is critical to making effective use of a deep learning approach with proven algorithm performance. One challenge in implementation of deep learning algorithm is to reduce memory bandwidth because a single memory access normally consumes 100× more energy than an arithmetic operation. To reduce the memory bandwidth, deep learning data could be compressed and decompressed before memory write/read operations. Especially, feature maps, which account for a significant portion of the convolutional neural network (CNN), could be compressed further by reducing the correlations between feature map planes. This paper proposes a compression method for feature maps in CNN that adaptively exploits the varying correlation between feature map planes. For every feature map plane, the proposed method searches the most similar plane among nearby planes in the same layer, and compresses the residual of the two planes instead of the plane itself. Experimental results show that the average bit length to store feature maps is reduced by 14.2% compared to the compression without correlation reduction, and the CNN accuracy does not change and additional training is also not required because the proposed method applies lossless compression. © 2021 IEEE","Adaptive Compression; Convolutional neural network; Feature map compression; Memory bandwidth reduction","Bandwidth; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Memory architecture; Adaptive compression; Algorithm performance; Arithmetic operations; Compression methods; Hardware architecture; Lossless compression; Memory bandwidths; Varying-correlations; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109042819

Therefore, cache compression is beneficial for applications with heavy memory traffic, including convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, a new cache compression of a floating-point number is proposed for CNNs. The exponent is compressed using the Golomb-Rice code, instead of the Huffman code, for an efficient hardware implementation. The compression syntax is carefully designed so that the size of compressed data is not very far from the entropy, which is the theoretical limit, by distinguishing two different types of data used in CNNs. On the other hand, since the mantissa of CNNs data can be hardly compressed by entropy coding, it is simply quantized for data reduction that may not degrade the CNN performance significantly thanks to the error robustness of CNNs. The quantization reduces 23 bits of a mantissa to 4 bits. The experimental results show that the miss rate of a 1 MB compressed cache with the proposed compression method applied is almost similar to that of an uncompressed 2 MB cache without any decrease of the CNN accuracy. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The fibrous ga2o3 templates were prepared by calcining the polymer/gallium precursor nanofiber synthesized by an electrospinning process, and their crystallinity was varied by controlling the calcination temperature from 500oC to 900oC. gaN nanostructures were transformed by nitriding the ga2o3 nanofibers using NH3 gas. All of the transformed gaN nanostructures maintained a one-dimensional structure well and exhibited a diameter of about 50 nm, but their morphology was clearly distinguished according to the crystallinity of the templates. When the templates having a relatively low crystallinity were used, the transformed gaN showed a hollow nanostructure, and as the crystallinity increased, gaN was converted into a denser nanostructure. This morphological difference can be explained as being caused by the difference in the diffusion rate of ga depending on the crystallinity of ga2o3 during the conversion from ga2o3 to gaN. it is expected that this technique will make possible the tubular nanostructure synthesis of nitride functional nanomaterials. © 2021.

Salmonella and Escherichia coli were inoculated into minced chicken based feed ingredients at 6.05±0.75 and 6.80±0.14 log CFU/g, respectively. Feed ingredients were irradiated at a dose of 3, 5, 7 and 10 kGy of gamma ray and electron beam irradiation. In the gamma ray irradiation, the microbial population of both Salmonella and E. coli was reduced to the limit of detection (LOD) level from the lowest dose of 3 kGy. Electron beam irradiation also inactivated both microorganisms under the LOD at 3 kGy. The lowest dose level of 3 kGy was sufficient to provide a pasteurization effect for both Salmonella and E. coli. For the quality attributes, gamma ray and electron beam irradiation did not show any detrimental effect on pH and color of minced chicken meat. Electronic nose analysis indicated an off flavor in irradiated chicken meat. With gamma ray irradiation, the off flavor was detected from the 3 kGy dose, showed similar levels up to 7 kGy, and then increased markedly after 10 kGy irradiation. Electron beam irradiation also induced the off flavor from 3 kGy, and this gradually increased in accordance with rises in the dose level. © 2021 Korean Society for Food Engineering.

This study examined how the participants selected LI for two types of test patterns. Twenty-one participants with interpupillary distances (IPDs) of 59–68 mm were selected. When the participants were asked to change the LI to match specific positions of the test pattern in which the shapes for the two eyes were different, the selected values of LI did not depend on the initial lens distances. When they were asked to change LI for their best viewing distances using the test pattern with the same shapes for two eyes, the selected values strongly depended on the initial lens conditions. This dependence can be attributed to the finite range of eye rotation inside which binocular fusion can occur. No noticeable dependence of the selected values on IPD was observed. Excessive eye rotation to enable binocular fusion can cause eye strain. In the former test pattern, binocular fusion does not occur, and each eye is aligned along its fusion-free eye position with little eye strain. Hence, the former test pattern using the different shapes is preferable for controlling the lens interval. © 2021 Society for Information Display.","binocular vision; fusional reserve; interpupillary distance (IPD); virtual reality (VR)","Binoculars; Virtual reality; Convex lens; Different shapes; Eye position; Eye strain; Test Pattern; Viewing distance; Testing",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108852048

Polyhedral elements are then placed on the structural boundaries, and regular hexahedral elements remain in the interior domain. In this study, an Abaqus user element subroutine (UEL) for trimmed hexahedral elements is developed to analyze hexahedral dominant meshes. The shape functions of trimmed hexahedral elements are explicitly expressed in the Abaqus UEL using the harmonic shape functions on master elements stored in advance, and numerical integration is performed based on a tetrahedral division of trimmed hexahedral elements. In Abaqus a dummy mesh with a user material subroutine (UMAT) is used to visualize the results of trimmed hexahedral meshes.

Aldosterone levels are elevated in human pulmonary arterial hypertension and in experimental pulmonary hypertension, while inhibition of the aldosterone-binding mineralocorticoid receptor attenuates pulmonary hypertension in multiple animal models. We explored the role of mineralocorticoid receptor in endothelial and smooth muscle cells in using cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mice exposed to sugen/hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Treatment with the mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitor spironolactone significantly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure. However, this is not reproduced by selective mineralocorticoid receptor deletion in smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells. Similarly, spironolactone attenuated the increase in right ventricular cardiomyocyte area independent of vascular mineralocorticoid receptor with no effect on right ventricular weight or interstitial fibrosis. Right ventricular perivascular fibrosis was significantly decreased by spironolactone and this was reproduced by specific deletion of mineralocorticoid receptor from endothelial cells. Endothelial cell-mineralocorticoid receptor deletion attenuated the sugen/hypoxia-induced increase in the leukocyte-adhesion molecule, E-selectin, and collagen IIIA1 in the right ventricle. Spironolactone also significantly reduced pulmonary arteriolar muscularization, independent of endothelial cell-mineralocorticoid receptor or smooth muscle cell-mineralocorticoid receptor. Finally, the degree of pulmonary perivascular inflammation was attenuated by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism and was fully reproduced by smooth muscle cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor deletion. These studies demonstrate that in the sugen/hypoxia pulmonary hypertension model, systemic-mineralocorticoid receptor blockade significantly attenuates the disease and that mineralocorticoid receptor has cell-specific effects, with endothelial cell-mineralocorticoid receptor contributing to right ventricular perivascular fibrosis and smooth muscle cell-mineralocorticoid receptor participating in pulmonary vascular inflammation. As mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are being investigated to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, these findings support novel mechanisms and potential mineralocorticoid receptor targets that mediate therapeutic benefits in patients. © The Author(s) 2021.","endothelial cell; experimental; mineralocorticoid receptor; pulmonary hypertension; right ventricle; spironolactone; vascular smooth muscle cell","collagen I A 1; collagen III A 1; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; galectin 3; genomic DNA; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; mineralocorticoid receptor; spironolactone; tamoxifen; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; Article; controlled study; female; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; pulmonary hypertension",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108146935

Glucose oxidase (GOx) covalently immobilized on magnetic particles and pH-sensitive liposomes encapsulating ferricyanide were added to a cyclic voltammeter cell solution in which glucose was distributed. The conversion of glucose into gluconic acid appeared to decrease the pH, which reduced the electrostatic repulsion between the headgroups of weakly acidic 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-succinate. The reduction destabilized the liposomes, which released the potassium ferricyanide encapsulated inside them. The effects of the glucose concentration and pH value were investigated. It was necessary to add more than 10 µL of 0.5 μg/mL glucose solution to the 5 mL cyclic voltammeter cell solution to observe a response. The activity of GOx was reversible with respect to the pH change between 7 and 5. The sensitivity of this detection was almost identical to that of comparable techniques such as the use of a field-effect transistor. Therefore, the methodology developed in this study is feasible as a portable and ultrasensitive method. © MYU K.K.","Cyclic voltammetry; Encapsulating ferricyanide; Gluconic acid; Glucose; PH-sensitive liposome","Field effect transistors; Glucose; Glucose sensors; Liposomes; pH sensors; Cyclic voltammeters; Electrostatic repulsion; Glucose concentration; Glucose detection; Glucose oxidases (GOx); Magnetic particle; pH-sensitive liposomes; Potassium ferricyanide; Glucose oxidase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107648953

The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX)-Paddy model was recently developed to improve the agro-hydrological characteristics of paddy ecosystems. This study explores the hydrology, total nitrogen (T-N) content, and rice yield behaviors of the APEX-Paddy model by simultaneously considering multiple parameters associated with different agricultural activities. Model performances with respect to runoff, T-N, and rice yield were assessed as good level of approved statistical criteria over the calibration and validation periods. Results showed that the APEX-Paddy model can simulate the behavior differences of soil nutrients between different agricultural activities, such as treatment with commercial mineral fertilizer or liquid manure application. Changes in mineral-nitrogen levels in root zones caused by fertilizers can affect T-N load and crop uptake.

In particular, networks trained using reinforcement learning (RL) are widely exploited for auxiliary tasks in various multimedia frameworks, including image restoration, image compression, and computer vision. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) are the representative lightweight compression methods that are most widely used for the purposes of frame memory compression and LCD overdrive. In precedent research, in order to improve the compression efficiency of DWT-SPIHT algorithms, the relative complexity of DWT coefficients is quantified, and when compressing DWT coefficients with the SPIHT algorithm, the compression ratio (CR) is adaptively allocated to the compression block according to the numerically expressed complexity. However, the SPIHT algorithm has the characteristic of resource limitation, resulting in the occurrence of remaining blocks, which cannot take advantage of allocating the adaptive CR. Moreover, since the equation expressing the block complexity that determines the CR of each block is obtained through machine learning-based linear regression, it lacks the capability to deal with a wide range of real-world images. To compensate for these drawbacks, this paper optimizes the compression efficiency of the 1-D DWT-SPIHT algorithm using the RL-based episodic auxiliary task. In detail, the proposed method optimally adjusts the proportion of CRs, which are adaptively selected for each block according to the DWT coefficient, through the episodic model trained with the RL algorithm. Consequently, the proposed method achieves an average improvement in peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 2.18dB compared to the baseline 1-D DWT-SPIHT with the fixed compression ratio and 0.68dB compared to the precedent research. © 2013 IEEE.","compression efficiency; Deep Q-learning; discrete wavelet transform; episodic auxiliary task; image compression; Reinforcement learning; set partitioning in hierarchical trees","Complex networks; Deep learning; Discrete wavelet transforms; Efficiency; Image coding; Image reconstruction; Reinforcement learning; Signal to noise ratio; Compression efficiency; Compression methods; Learning technology; Multimedia frameworks; Peak signal to noise ratio; Relative complexity; Resource limitations; Set partitioning in hierarchical tree; Image compression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107365884

With the model, three feedback controllers, i.e., linear quadratic regulator (LQR), $H_{\infty }$ and sliding mode controller (SMC), are designed. Feedforward controller with the lateral acceleration is designed with a discrete-time state-space equation to improve roll control performance. To estimate the roll angle and the lateral acceleration simultaneously with noisy roll rate measurement, a discrete-time Kalman filter (DTKF) is used. When applying DTKF for state and disturbance estimation, a recursive least square (RLS) is adopted to estimate the parameters of 1-DOF roll model. As an actuator for ARS, an active anti-roll bar (AARB) and a continuous damping control (CDC) are adopted.

We performed co-registration using each Level 1R and Level 1G image as a reference image, and Level 1R image as a sensed image. For constructing the experimental dataset, seven Level 1R and 1G images of KOMPSAT-3 and KOMPSAT-3A acquired from Daejeon, South Korea, were used. To coarsely align the geometric position of the two images, SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Feature) and PC (Phase Correlation) methods were combined and then repeatedly applied to the overlapping region of the images. Then, we extracted tie-points using the SURF method from coarsely aligned images and performed fine co-registration through affine transformation and piecewise Linear transformation, respectively, constructed with the tie-points. As a result of the experiment, when Level 1G image was used as a reference image, a relatively large number of tie-points were extracted than Level 1R image. Also, in the case where the reference image is Level 1G image, the root mean square error of co-registration was 5 pixels less than the case of Level 1R image on average.

Numerical analysis for wind environment prediction is underway in many fields, such as dense areas of high-rise building or composition of the apartment complexes, a precisive 3D building model is essentially required in this process. Many studies conducted for wind environment analysis have typically used the method of creating a 3D model by utilizing the building layer included in the GIS (Geographic Information System) data. These data can easily and quickly observe the flow of atmosphere in a wide urban environment, but cannot be suitable for observing precisive flow of atmosphere, and in particular, the effect of a complicated structure of a single building on the flow of atmosphere cannot be calculated. Recently, drone photogrammetry has shown the advantage of being able to automatically perform building modeling based on a large number of images. In this study, we applied photogrammetry technology using a drone to evaluate the flow of atmosphere around two buildings located close to each other. Two 3D models were made into an automatic modeling technique and manual modeling technique. Auto-modeling technique is using an automatically generates a point cloud through photogrammetry and generating models through interpolation, and manual-modeling technique is a manually operated technique that individually generates 3D models based on point clouds. And then the flow of atmosphere for the two models was compared and analyzed. As a result, the wind environment of the two models showed a clear difference, and the model created by auto-modeling showed faster flow of atmosphere than the model created by manual modeling. Also in the case of the 3D mesh generated by auto-modeling showed the limitation of not proceeding an accurate analysis because the precise 3D shape was not reproduced in the closed area such as the porch of the building or the bridge between buildings. © 2021 Korean Society of Surveying.

The percentages of change in precipitation and temperature were estimated for the near (2025–2060) and far future (2065–2100) for two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of CMIP5 and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)2–4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios of CMIP6.

To overcome this challenge, we propose fast deep learning (DL)-aided SD (FDL-SD) and fast DL-aided K-best SD (KSD, FDL-KSD) algorithms. Therein, the major application of DL is to generate a highly reliable initial candidate to accelerate the search in SD and KSD in conjunction with candidate/layer ordering and early rejection. Compared to existing DL-aided SD schemes, our proposed schemes are more advantageous in both offline training and online application phases. Specifically, unlike existing DL-aided SD schemes, they do not require performing the conventional SD in the training phase. For a 24 &#x00D7; 24 MIMO system with QPSK, the proposed FDL-SD achieves a complexity reduction of more than 90% without any performance loss compared to conventional SD schemes. For a 32 &#x00D7; 32 MIMO system with QPSK, the proposed FDL-KSD only requires K = 32 to attain the performance of the conventional KSD with K = 256, where K is the number of survival paths in KSD.

In this study, we propose an Au–NiCo MEMS vertical probe with an enhanced CCC to efficiently reduce the damage to the probe and various interconnect structures, including a solder ball, Cu pillar microbump, and TSV. The Au–NiCo probe has an Au layer inside the NiCo and an Au layer outside the surface of the NiCo probe to reduce resistivity and contact stress. The current-carrying capacity, contact stress, and deformation behavior of the probe and various interconnect structures were evaluated using numerical analyses. The Au–NiCo probe had a 150% higher CCC than the conventional NiCo probe. The maximum allowable current capacity of the 5000 µm-long Au–NiCo probe was 750 mA. The Au–NiCo probe exhibited less contact force and stress than the NiCo probe. The Au–NiCo probe also produced less deformation of various interconnect structures.

This joining method has been commonly used in various areas of engineering (e.g. aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering) as it has been proven one of the most effective means to join parts together. Although it has its advantages, the vibration that bolted structures endure during service ultimately causes the bolts to loosen. This can, in turn, have a negative effect on the structure’s safety and may, at worst, cause it to fail. Routine inspections of structures are conducted on a regular basis, with some inspection categories requiring heavy equipment in order to acquire certain data. In addition, monitoring systems can be expensive to install and maintain, especially in large infrastructures.

The downstream analysis of multiple associated sequences has become a bottleneck for the growing genomic data due to storage and space utilization issues in the domain of bioinformatics. The traditional string-matching algorithms are efficient for small sized data sequences and cannot process large amounts of data for downstream analysis. This study proposes a novel bit-parallelism algorithm called BitmapAligner to overcome the issues faced due to a large number of sequences and to improve the speed and quality of multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The input files (sequences) tested over BitmapAligner can be easily managed and organized using the Hadoop distributed file system. The proposed aligner converts the test file (the whole genome sequence) into binaries of an equal length of the sequence, line by line, before the sequence alignment processing. The Hadoop distributed file system splits the larger files into blocks, based on a defined block size, which is 128MB by default. BitmapAligner can accurately process the sequence alignment using the bitmask approach on large-scale sequences after sorting the data. The experimental results indicate that BitmapAligner operates in real time, with a large number of sequences.Moreover, BitmapAligner achieves the exact start and end positions of the pattern sequence to test the MSA application in the whole genome query sequence. The MSA's accuracy is verified by the bitmask indexing property of the bit-parallelism extended shifts (BXS) algorithm. The dynamic and exact approach of the BXS algorithm is implemented through the MapReduce function of Apache Hadoop. Conversely, the traditional seeds-and-extend approach faces the risk of errors while identifying the pattern sequences' positions.Moreover, the proposed model resolves the largescale data challenges that are covered through MapReduce in the Hadoop framework. Hive, Yarn, HBase, Cassandra, and many other pertinent flavors are to be used in the future for data structuring and annotations on the top layer of Hadoop since Hadoop is primarily used for data organization and handles text documents. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The following conclusions were drawn with this in mind. When the transmission is applied, the constant-velocity driving fuel economy and the battery-to-wheel efficiency are greatly improved. The fuel economy and efficiency are also significantly improved at low-velocity driving. In addition, if the transmission is adopted, the efficiency decreases as the velocity increases, whereas in the case of a single reducer, the efficiency increases at a high velocity. Also, the application of the transmission drastically improves the fuel economy of driving in urban areas, mainly due to the improvement of efficiency in low-velocity areas. Lastly, for further improvement of vehicle performance through the application of a transmission, an appropriate combination of motor power and transmission ratio is required.

The accumulated installation of PV systems has expanded rapidly, reaching over 700 GW in 2020. Although black colored PVs maximize energy generation by harvesting a broad range of solar light, their monotonous color limits their installation in urban areas and portable devices where the harmonization of color with neighboring exterior elements is a high priority. Moreover, it is not suitable for covering transparent area of buildings, such as window and curtain wall. Hence, the demand for aesthetic PV systems is increasing significantly. In this review, we focus on the current status of colored PV systems and their prospects for aesthetic energy harvesting system. This work reviews possible approaches to realize colored PV systems by implementing semitransparent cells, selective reflective films, and luminophores. Additionally, the research progress to minimize light sacrifice for color production has been investigated. Moreover, the technical limitations of each technology for colored PV systems are presented in terms of color purity and efficiency.

ZnO in the form of nanorods has been studied intensively for application in self-powering devices. The power generation in piezoelectric nanogenerators based on ZnO nanorods can be improved via several approaches, including an oxygen plasma treatment. When ZnO nanorods are exposed to oxygen plasma, the charge carrier concentration decreases and the piezoelectric output voltage consequently increases. However, the effects of oxygen plasma on the mechanical properties of ZnO nanorods has not been systematically studied using a precise measurement technique. Given the size of ZnO nanorods, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a suitable method for manipulating individual ZnO nanorods and measuring their elastic properties. In the present work, we observed the effects of oxygen plasma on the elemental composition and microstructure of ZnO nanorods. First of all, the surface roughness of the ZnO nanorods was analyzed using AFM, revealing that it increased due to the etching effect of the oxygen plasma. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, three distinct peaks corresponding to lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies, and absorbed oxygen on the surface were identified. The XPS analysis results showed that oxygen vacancy defects on the ZnO nanorods were decreased by oxygen plasma treatment. Next, the effects of oxygen plasma on the elastic properties of ZnO nanorods were studied using lateral force microscopy. It was confirmed that the elastic modulus of ZnO nanorods increased due to the reduced number of defects originating from oxygen vacancies. © The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials.","Lateral force microscopy; Nanogenerator; Nanorod; Oxygen plasma; Piezoelectric; Zinc oxide","Atomic force microscopy; Carrier concentration; Elasticity; Etching; II-VI semiconductors; Magnetic semiconductors; Nanogenerators; Nanorods; Oxide minerals; Piezoelectricity; Plasma applications; Semiconducting zinc compounds; Surface roughness; Wide band gap semiconductors; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc oxide; Elastic properties; Elemental compositions; Lateral force microscopy; Oxygen plasma treatments; Oxygen vacancy defects; Piezoelectric property; Precise measurements; Zinc oxide (ZnO); Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104629373

In the main circuit, a current doubling synchronous rectifying circuit based on IGBT is presented to further reduce the power loss of power devices. Moreover, in the control strategy, in view of the existing researches, the basic BP neural network PID control performance of the rectifying converter still can be further improved. Therefore, this paper combines the quasi-Newton algorithm and traditional GA to propose an improved GA-BP (IGA-BP) neural network to further improve PID control performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the maximum efficiency of 5 V/500A rectifying converter based on the proposed circuit scheme can reach 94.1%, and the rectifying converter has a good performance of excellent waveform and wide range of load. IGA-BP neural network PID control responds fast and reaches the stable state quickly in comparison with that controlled by the GA-BP neural network control strategy, and the steady-state time can be reduced by 10.5% through using IGA-BP neural network control strategy. This study can provide a valuable guidance and reference, not only in circuit scheme but also in the optimal PID control strategy for design of the high-efficiency DC/DC rectifying converter with higher power in the future. © 2021 Hemiao Liu et al.",,"Backpropagation; DC-DC converters; Efficiency; Electric network analysis; Electric rectifiers; Genetic algorithms; Three term control systems; BP neural networks; Control performance; Control strategies; Ga-bp neural networks; Maximum Efficiency; Optimal PID control; Quasi-newton algorithm; Steady state time; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104478698

This paper proposes a deep time-economical Q network (DQN) input image preprocessing method to train an autonomous vehicle agent in a virtual environment. The environmental information is extracted from the virtual environment. A top-view image of the entire environment is then redrawn according to the environmental information. During training of the DQN model, the top-view image is cropped to place the vehicle agent at the center of the cropped image. The current frame top-view image is combined with the images from the previous two training iterations. The DQN model use this combined image as input. The experimental results indicate higher performance and shorter training time for the DQN model trained with the preprocessed images compared with that trained without preprocessing. © 2021, ComSIS Consortium.

The desired properties of Fe, Co and Ni NPs and NCs were achieved by co-precipitation, the addition of surfactants and changes in reduction temperature and time parameters. Magnetic measurements showed that all samples of pure metal NPs are semi-hard magnetic materials. The added surfactants have distinct effects on the dimensional and magnetic characteristics of Fe, Co and Ni NPs. Ni–Co–Fe NCs are also mainly semi-hard magnetic materials.

Therefore, a resistance-free antibacterial therapy is necessary to overcome MDR MRSA infections. In this study, an antibacterial nanorobot (Ab-nanobot) is developed wherein a cell wall-binding domain (CBD)-endolysin, acting as a sensor, is covalently conjugated with an actuator consisting of an iron oxide/silica core–shell. The CBD-endolysin sensor shows an excellent specificity to detect, bind, and accumulate on the S. aureus USA300 cell surface even in a bacterial consortium, and in host cell infections. Ab-nanobot specifically captures and kills MRSA in response to medically approved radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic stimulation (EMS) signal. When Ab-nanobot receives the RF-EMS signal on the cell surface, actuator induces cell death in MRSA with 99.999% removal within 20 min by cell-wall damage via generation of localized heat and reactive oxygen species. The in vivo efficacy of Ab-nanobot is proven using a mice subcutaneous skin infection model.

Whereas 3D model-based methods provide realistic deformations of the clothing, it needs a difficult 3D model construction process and cannot handle the non-clothing areas well. Image-based deep neural network methods are good at generating disclosed human parts, retaining the unchanged area, and blending image parts, but cannot handle large deformation of clothing.

While the mmWave band provides a very wide under-utilized bandwidth, NOMA enhances the spectral efficiency compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). The combination of these two techniques could be considered as the key solution to the high required data rates in next-generation communication systems. The implementation of NOMA is studied and verified under an ideal condition with perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS). However, under the practical conditions, the fluctuation of the wireless channel makes perfect CSI unachievable at the BS. Hence, we proposed to use the angle of departure (AoD) as feedback information from UEs to the BS. We assume that, mobile users (UEs) perfectly estimate the channel by detecting the pilot signals. Then, UEs quantize the AoD and feed back to the BS. Finally, the BS uses the AoD to perform user clustering, power allocation and beamforming. To reduce the feedback overhead further, we proposed a user clustering algorithm which uses one-bit feedback to determine the change of the AoD. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NOMA system outperforms the conventional orthogonal multiple-access (OMA) system with the same amount of feedback information. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

To this purpose, we have extended the original SLIC algorithm to use the operations in Apache Spark, supporting its parallel processing on multiple executors in the Apache Spark cluster. Then, we analyze the trade-off relationship of PSLIC-on-Spark between its processing speed and accuracy due to partitioning of the original image data sets. Especially, we identify two limitations in PSLIC-on-Spark, which degrade the accuracy of the original SLIC. Through experiments, we verify the trade-off relationship. Specifically, we show that PSLIC-on-Spark using 8 CPU cores reduces the processing time of SLIC by 2. 24∼2.93 times while it reduces the boundary recall (BR) of SLIC by 1. 54∼6.32 % and increases under-segmentation error (UE) by 1. 79∼6.2 %. In contrast, PSLIC-on-Spark using 2 CPU cores reduces the processing time of SLIC by 1.38∼1.45 times while it reduces the BR of SLIC by 0. 28∼1.5 %, and increases UE by 0. 25∼1.77 %. We also verify the effectiveness of PSLIC-on-Spark to deal with a large-scale image by showing that the processing speed of PSLIC-on-Spark becomes much more efficient as the image size becomes large. Specifically, compared to the original SLIC, the proposed SLIC-on-Spark reduces its processing time by 2.23 times for the image of 480×320 pixels and by 5.59 times for the image of 2002×1335 pixels, respectively © 2021 IEEE.","Accuracy; Apache Spark; Image Segmentation; Parallel Processing; SLIC","Big data; Pixels; CPU cores; Original images; Parallel processing; Processing speed; Processing time; Segmentation error; Trade-off analysis; Trade-off relationship; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102977084

It is clear that securing students’ safety and prevention from the victimization of vulnerable students is important to attain educational goals and to provide diverse extra-curriculum activities for students. Further, campus dormitory is a focal area for students to experience social interaction between many students from diverse cultural background, thus leading personal growth and increasing the degree of satisfaction with college life. The purpose of this study intended to examine the effects of CPTED elements on the facilitation of students’ social interaction through the survey of students living in dormitory. Review of literature illuminated that defensible space, natural surveillance, social control, and criminal justice were important measures to deter any possible crime. A chi-square analysis found that social interaction and CPTED were statistically significant on personal characteristics. Correlation analysis and ANOVA confirmed that the degree of CPTED influenced on the level of social interaction among students living in dormitory; As the satisfaction with CPTED increases, the degree of social interaction rises at positive linear direction. Further the study reported that role of CCTV is a prime element for the facilitation of social interaction. An IPA also demonstrated that securing safety in night walking around dormitory environment and role of CCTV were the most urgent improvement items needed. Finally the study suggests that more careful design details and guidelines in design stage be explored in relation with major theoretical findings, even though research limitation exists from limited survey samples and target population. © 2021, Architectural Institute of Korea.

However, it can be also viewed as general planning restrictions through the balance of public and private interest due to the secured premise of floor area ratio incentives. Therefore, it merely gives the landowner a public legal obligation to open the part to the public for 24 hours, rather than secures the right to use the part of the land. Second, there is a fundamental limit because the National Land Utilization and Planning Act does not have a proper tool to enforce the property owner when he/she violates the obligations. Third, in order to overcome the legal limitations, it is necessary to secure the legal right to use the part of private property through the easement or partial air right under the Korea’s property law. © 2021 Architectural Institute of Korea.","District Unit Plan; Public Pedestrian Passage; Through-Block-Connection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102795231

However, it may be argued that CA and LT lack sufficient paradigmatic overlap to make joint-contributions to L2 classroom instruction meaningful. For example, each has different research mandates, CA focusing on descriptions of interactional behavior with little interest in psycholinguistic processes (Markee N, Conversation analysis. Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, 2000; Markee N, Kasper G, Mod Lang J 88:491–500, 2004), which is in contrast to LT’s oft-explicit theoretical focus (e.g., Messick S, Educational measurement. Collier Macmillan Publishers, London, 1989; Bachman L, Fundamental considerations in language testing. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990). Moreover, both fields approach the subject of language norms from differing perspectives, which is problematic in regard to effective L2 classroom instruction. As an attempt at a resolution to these matters, this chapter offers, first, a comparative analysis of how CA and LT each view these methodological and epistemological issues, with reference to test validity (e.g., Bachman LF, Palmer A, Language testing in practice. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996; Kane M, Educational measurement. Praeger, Westport, 2006). Following this, empirical data in the form of transcribed extracts from test responses to a CA-informed test (CAIT) of L2 oral proficiency will be examined. The aim will be to consider practical links between CA and LT and to offer a set of test-development principles possibly useful for L2 teachers interested in applying CA to their classroom assessments. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conversation analysis; Epistemology; Language norms; Language testing; Test validity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102745530

This problem arises in several applications where data distributions uctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis. This work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced (Blanchard et al., 2011).

Previous studies focused on security threat detection and blocking technologies that rely on testbed data obtained from a single medical IoT device or simulation using a well-known dataset, such as the NSL-KDD dataset. However, such approaches do not re_ect the features that exist in real medical scenarios, leading to failure in potential threat detection. To address this problem, we proposed a novel intrusion classification architecture known as a Multi-class Classification based Intrusion Detection Model (M-IDM),which typically relies on data collected by real devices and the use of convolutional neural networks (i.e., it exhibits better performance compared with conventional machine learning algorithms, such as naïve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM)). Unlike existing studies, the proposed architecture employs the actual healthcare IoT environment of National Cancer Center in South Korea and actual network data from real medical devices, such as a patient s monitors (i.e., electrocardiogram and thermometers). The proposed architecture classifies the data into multiple classes: Critical, informal, major, and minor, for intrusion detection.

In the case of a rigid vortex generator, energy loss is generated owing to a high pressure drop. In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted to improve heat transfer using a flexible vortex generator. In this study, an asymmetric inclined flexible flag was adopted as the vortex generator and an immersed boundary method was used to consider the fluid-flexible body interaction. When the bending rigidity of the flexible vortex generator was constant, the fluttering motion of the vortex generator increased as the inclination angle increased, and vortex structures were produced by the fluttering motion, thereby increasing the heat transfer. When the inclination angles were 45° and 135°, the heat transfer was observed to be increased by 2% and 116%, respectively. © 2021 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers","Enhancement of Heat Transfer; Flexible Vortex Generators; Fluid-Structure-Thermal Interaction; Immersed Boundary Method","Energy dissipation; Heat transfer; Turbulent flow; Vorticity; Bending rigidity; Designing systems; Enhancement of heat transfer; Flexible bodies; Immersed boundary methods; Inclination angles; Vortex generators; Vortex structures; Vortex flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102305616

The internal and external cantilevers used for piezoelectric and electromagnetic conversion, respectively, are arranged such that the piezoelectric internal cantilever can vibrate with a large displacement to produce high output power. We use a frequency up-conversion method to convert the bending of the harvester into the vibration of the structure so that the harvester can generate energy even from the mechanical motion with an extremely low frequency.

Preclinical studies reveal that the benefits on cardiac remodeling and dysfunction are not completely explained by inhibition of MR in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, or endothelial cells. The role of MR in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in HF has never been explored. Methods: Male mice with inducible deletion of MR from SMCs (SMC-MR-knockout) and their MR-intact littermates were exposed to HF induced by 27-gauge transverse aortic constriction versus sham surgery. HF phenotypes and mechanisms were measured 4 weeks later using cardiac ultrasound, intracardiac pressure measurements, exercise testing, histology, cardiac gene expression, and leukocyte flow cytometry. Results: Deletion of MR from SMC attenuated transverse aortic constriction-induced HF with statistically significant improvements in ejection fraction, cardiac stiffness, chamber dimensions, intracardiac pressure, pulmonary edema, and exercise capacity. Mechanistically, SMC-MR-knockout protected from adverse cardiac remodeling as evidenced by decreased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fetal gene expression, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, and inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression. Exposure to pressure overload resulted in a statistically significant decline in cardiac capillary density and coronary flow reserve in MR-intact mice. These vascular parameters were improved in SMC-MR-knockout mice compared with MR-intact littermates exposed to transverse aortic constriction. Conclusions: These results provide a novel paradigm by which MR inhibition may be beneficial in HF by blocking MR in SMC, thereby improving cardiac blood supply in the setting of pressure overload-induced hypertrophy, which in turn mitigates the adverse cardiac remodeling that contributes to HF progression and symptoms. © 2021 American Heart Association, Inc.","constriction; endothelial cell; hospitalization; hypertrophy; phenotype","mineralocorticoid receptor; animal; aorta; arterial pressure; cardiac muscle cell; cardiomegaly; diagnostic imaging; disease model; echocardiography; gene knockout; genetics; heart failure; heart ventricle remodeling; metabolism; mouse; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; smooth muscle cell; stenosis, occlusion and obstruction; surgery; vascular smooth muscle; Animals; Aorta; Arterial Pressure; Cardiomegaly; Constriction, Pathologic; Disease Models, Animal; Echocardiography; Gene Knockout Techniques; Heart Failure; Mice; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Myocytes, Cardiac; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Receptors, Mineralocorticoid; Ventricular Remodeling",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102211386

Rev. Lett., vol. 113, 2014, p. 238105). In the present study, a numerical simulation is conducted with two self-propelled flexible fins in the tandem configuration near a single wall (1W) and two parallel walls (2W). Contrary to the vortex interception for 0W, the follower employs spontaneously a mixed mode (i.e. a combination of the vortex interception mode and the slalom mode) for 1W and the slalom mode for 2W. Although the lateral motion of the follower for 0W, 1W and 2W is synchronized with the induced lateral flow generated by the leader, the time-averaged input power of the follower for 1W and 2W is reduced significantly due to the enhanced lateral flow by the vortex-vortex interaction near the wall. The jet-like flow opposite to the moving direction continuously hinders the movement of the follower for 0W, whereas the follower for 1W and 2W utilizes the negative horizontal flow when passing between the main vortex and the induced vortex near the wall, leading to a decrease of the thrust force acting on the follower allowing the follower to keep pace with the leader. The global efficiency of the schooling fins is optimized with a small heaving amplitude of the follower and a critical value of phase difference between the leader and follower when the values of the wall proximity and bending rigidity are moderate. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

However, as an adjunct to CAD software, generative design is only being used as a means of obtaining a simple result and at certain points. Therefore, scientific measures to succeed as a convergent process, which can produce and use various outputs, are required. Methods This study used documentary research and case study methods and carried out in-depth interviews with experts in order to figure out how to make good use of generative design in the product design development process. First, implications of the use of generative design were deduced by considering theories about product design and generative design and by researching actual product development cases, which used generative design and followed general product design process. Second, in-depth interviews with product design experts were conducted. Those interviews dealt with subjects, which are: ways and possibilities of using generative design in the product design process. How generative design can be used in each stage of the product design process was then studied by using comparative analysis. Results According to the findings, it seems that generative design is more than just an umbrella encompassing topology and shape optimization and can inspire designers to study models creatively by being used deliberately in every stage of the product design process. Generative design can be used not only to create the structure and shape, which match variables and options as usual, but also to create various models by setting variables and options as designers intend. Furthermore, such models can be applied to design. Conclusions With the establishment of the product design process using generative design, it can be expected that designers will be able to use outputs created using generative design to improve the structure of the product and to ideate and search for creative models depending on their circumstances and goals. Also, the product design processes using generative design are expected to be used as new convergent/composite processes. © 2021.

The input parameters of the model were composed of alloying elements (Mn, Si, Al, Nb, Ti, and V) and microstructural factors (pearlite fraction, ferrite grain size, interlamellar spacing, and cementite thickness), while the output parameters of the model were yield strength and tensile strength. Although the ferrite-pearlite steels have complex relationships among the alloying elements, microstructural factors, and tensile properties, the ANN model predictions were found to be more accurate with experimental results than the existing equation model. In the present study the individual effect of input parameters on the tensile properties was quantitatively estimated with the help of the average index of the relative importance for alloying elements as well as microstructural factors.

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an evidence-based threat detection and prevention system. CTI system analyzes and shares the security data to mitigate evolving cyber threats using security-related data. However, to gather enough amount of data for analysis, the CTI system uses various data collection channels. The reliability of data collected from these channels is a critical issue because the inaccurate and vast amount of information could degrade the performance of threat detection. Thus, proper filtering is needed to remove the noise data. In this paper, we propose a data noise-reduction algorithm. The proposed algorithm reflects the contextual characteristics of CTI data and reduces noise data in the CTI dataset. Noise-reduced dataset increases the performance of machine learning and deep learning-based attack prediction models. In our experiment, we conducted a cyber-attack classification using a noise-reduced CTI dataset.

However, in the process of long-term structural health monitoring, sensor defects and data loss commonly occur, which pose limitations in the current SHM technique. To recover lost data and predict structural responses, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in SHM, but no obvious technique or rule for configuring CNN architecture with optimal performance has been presented yet. This study proposes a method for searching for the optimal CNN architecture capable of predicting the structural response of structures to evaluate their long-term safety. In this method, multi-objective optimization, considering both prediction performance and CNN training efficiency, is presented as a strategy. The optimization method using the two objective functions is applied to the structural response estimation, and the characteristics of the derived solutions are examined. Furthermore, the solutions derived using the two objective functions are classified into two solution groups that are biased to each objective function, and a strategy for minimizing the discrepancy between the two solution groups is additionally presented based on their trade-off relationship. The architecture characteristics, estimation performance, and training efficiency of the solutions derived by setting the discrepancy as the third objective function are investigated. The CNN derived by the proposed method with the third objective function reduced 40.35% of computational cost compared with that derived with two objective functions while they showed similar accuracies for the response estimation. © 2013 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; data prediction; genetic algorithm; measurement; multi-objective optimization; structural health monitoring","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Forecasting; Multiobjective optimization; Network architecture; Estimation performance; Objective functions; Optimal performance; Prediction performance; Safety of structures; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Trade-off relationship; Training efficiency; Structural health monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101447974

This is because the phone screen becomes obscured by these residuals, which significantly lower the guess rate of the pattern lock. To address this, this paper proposes a novel attack method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are known to exhibit high accuracy in image classification. However, using only CNNs for the attack is not sufficient, because there are 389,112 possible patterns, and training the CNN for all the cases is difficult. We therefore propose two ideas to overcome the aforementioned problem. The first one is the application of ’Screen Segmentation,’ where we divide the screen into four segments to reduce the number of possible patterns to 1470 in each segment. The second is the use of pruning rules, which reduces the number of total pattern cases by combining the patterns in each segment. Furthermore, by applying the Android pattern lock constraints, we reduce the number of possible patterns. To validate the proposed idea, we collected 3500 image data by photographing the screen of Android smartphones and generated 367,500 image data based on their possible combinations. Using those data sets, we conducted an experiment whereby we investigated the success rate of our attack in various situations, dealing with different pattern lock lengths and type of prior application usage. The result shows that up to a pattern lock length of seven, the proposed method has on an average, 79% success rate, which is meaningful result in smudge attacks. In addition, in an ideal case where only the actual pattern lock is entered, without oily residuals, the proposed scheme supports an even higher performance, i.e., a 93% successful guess rate on an average. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Authentication; CNN; Information Security; Smudge Attack","Convolutional neural networks; Locks (fasteners); Smartphones; Attack methods; High-accuracy; Image data; Lock-on; Pattern extraction; Android (operating system)",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101282644

Although they show their strengths in blending the person and try-on clothing image and synthesizing the dis-occluded regions, their results for complex-posed persons are often unsatisfactory due to the limitations in their geometry deformation and texture-preserving capacity. To address these challenges, we propose CloTH-VTON+ for seamlessly integrating the image-based deep learning methods and the strength of the 3D model in shape deformation. Specifically, a fully automatic pipeline is developed for 3D clothing model reconstruction and deformation using a reference human model: first, the try-on clothing is matched to the target clothing regions in the simple shaped reference human model, and then the 3D clothing model is reconstructed. The reconstructed 3D clothing model can generate a very natural pose and shape transfer, retaining the textures of clothes. A clothing refinement network further refines the alignment, eliminating the misalignment due to the errors in human pose estimation and 3D deformation. The deformed clothing images are combined utilizing conditional generative networks to in-paint the dis-occluded areas and blend them all. Experiments on an existing benchmark dataset demonstrate that CloTH-VTON+ generates higher quality results in comparison to the state-of-the-art VTON systems and CloTH-VTON. CloTH-VTON+ can be incorporated into extended applications such as multi-pose guided and Video VTON. © 2013 IEEE.","3D clothing reconstruction; generative network model; hybrid approach; Online fashion; virtual try-on","3D modeling; Alignment; Benchmarking; Clothes; Deep learning; Deformation; Image reconstruction; Learning systems; Textures; Virtual reality; Benchmark datasets; Human pose estimations; Learning methods; Model reconstruction; Shape deformation; State of the art; Texture preserving; Three-dimensional reconstruction; Three dimensional computer graphics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101261250

To address this issue, many BSS operators rearrange bikes using a fleet of trucks. Moreover, the effectiveness and efficiency of rebalancing operations heavily rely on accurate traffic prediction in BSS. Hence, many researchers have developed methods to enhance the prediction performance. One approach to increase the accuracy is to hierarchically predict demand from higher level (cluster or system) to station level. In the hierarchical prediction frameworks, the cluster-level to predict the demand of the total usage of groups of stations is introduced and it is crucial to partition stations into clusters that can increase the stability of actual usage and prediction. Therefore, the present work proposes a new spatial contiguity-constrained hierarchical clustering algorithm for BSS. The proposed algorithm is based on hierarchical clustering, which is deterministic, and uses the hourly proportions of check-outs and check-ins to define the temporal usage pattern of each station that does not require cluster assignment. Thus, different from existing methods, our proposed algorithm is deterministic and fast. In addition, the proposed algorithm is proven to be superior to other clustering methods in terms of traffic prediction at both the cluster and station levels.

Recently, the development of liquid-repelling surfaces has moved from the fabrication of artificial structures to real applications that address friction associated with clothes, paper, and skin. To have superoleophobicity, re-entrant structures such as mushrooms or inverse trapezoids have been suggested. However they can be mechanically fragile, especially under shear stress, because the bottom region is narrow. Here, a facile method to obtain new re-entrant structures is proposed, namely, micro-hyperbola structures, by wetting a photocurable viscous liquid around micropillars by capillary force. It is demonstrated that the formation of the hyperbola structures depends on the spacing ratio between micropillars, and the formation mechanism is explained with a simple model. The micro-hyperbola structure demonstrates robust omniphobicity even after rubbing and abrasion tests. The advantage of the wide fabrication range and the robust superoleophobicity of micro-hyperbola structures enable the uses in practical superomniphobic applications that undergo shear forces. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","capillary force; hyperbola structures; meniscus; micropillars; superomniphobic surface",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100571490

However, object detection using deep learning requires many hardware (HW) resources due to the huge computations for high performance, making it very difficult to run real-time on embedded platforms. Therefore, various compression methods have been studied to solve this problem. In particular, quantization methods greatly reduce the computational burden of deep learning by reducing the number of bits used for weights and activation functions in deep learning. However, most of these existing studies targeted only object classification and cannot be applied to object detection. Furthermore, most of the existing quantization studies are based on floating-point operations, which requires additional effort when implementing HW accelerators. This paper proposes an HW-friendly fixed-point-based quantization method that can also be applied to object detection. In the proposed method, the center of the weight distribution is adjusted to zero by subtracting the mean of weight parameters before quantization, and the retraining process is iteratively applied to minimize the accuracy drop caused by quantization. Furthermore, while applying the proposed method to object detection, performance degradation is minimized by considering the minimum and maximum values of weight parameters of deep learning networks. When applying the proposed quantization method to representative one-stage object detectors, You Only Look Once v3 and v4 (YOLOv3 and YOLOv4), detection accuracy similar to the original networks (i.e., YOLOv3 and YOLOv4) with a single-precision floating-point format (32-bit) is maintained despite expressing weights with only about 20% of the bits compared to a single-precision floating-point format in COCO dataset. © 2013 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; deep neural network; fixed-point quantization; network compression; object detector; YOLOv3; YOLOv4","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital arithmetic; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Object recognition; Activation functions; Compression methods; Computational burden; Embedded platforms; Floating point operations; Object classification; Performance degradation; Weight distributions; Object detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100499208

The viscosity and flowability of the ceramic nanocomposite resins were optimized by adjusting the amounts of non-reactive diluents. The ceramic 3D-printed objects have a high polymer content compared to ceramics samples manufactured by conventional manufacturing processes, and the attraction between layers is weak because of the layer-by-layer additive method. This causes problems such as layer separation and cracking due to internal stress generated when materials such as solvents and polymers are separated from the objects during the drying and debinding processes; therefore, the drying and debinding conditions of 3YSZ ceramic 3D-printed objects were optimized based on thermogravimetry–differential thermal analysis. The sintering conditions at various temperatures and times were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, SEM, and flexural strength analysis, and the body of the 3YSZ ceramic 3D-printed object that sintered at 1450◦C for 150 min had a relative density of 99.95% and flexural strength of 1008.5 MPa.

In this research, high-energy ball milling was used to distribute various volume fractions of sub-micron-sized SiCp particles (2, 10, and 20 vol%) in AA2024 aluminum powder alloy, focusing on powder morphology and milling conditions. An increase in the full width at half-maximum and the shifting of peaks at higher angles were observed after mechanical alloying. These examinations were attributed to changes in the lattice parameters of the matrix alloy. It was noted that the temperature and loading pressure during the die compaction stages of MMC powders directly affect the compact density, whereas the volume fraction of SiCp changes hardness. Compression testing, conducted at elevated temperatures to evaluate the plastic properties of the material, showed sufficient ductility characteristics for thermomechanical processing.

Through the comparative analysis of domestic building design guides, codes, and special legislation related to disasters, a risk assessment methodology for quantitative results was developed. The assessment method consists of a classification system, a calculation for the quantification of risk, and a simulation in which the developed checklist for the K-IDES is applied to similar types of high-rise buildings to validate its accuracy.

Toxicomics is defined as the combination of toxicology and omics technologies and encompasses toxicogenomics, toxicoproteomics, and toxicometabolomics. This paper reviews the trend of applying omics technologies to evaluate cadmium (Cd) toxicity in zebrafish (D. rerio). Cd is a toxic heavy metal posing several environmental concerns; however, it is being used widely in everyday life. Zebrafish embryos and larvae are employed as standard models for many toxicity tests because they share 71.4% genetic homology with humans. This study summarizes the toxicity of Cd on the nerves, liver, heart, skeleton, etc. of zebrafish and introduces detailed omics techniques to understand the results of the toxicomic studies. Finally, the trend of toxicity evaluation in the zebrafish model of Cd based on omics technology is presented. © 2021, Korean Society of Toxicology.","Cadmium; Toxicogenomics; Toxicometabolomics; Toxicoproteomics; Zebrafish",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099860159

Cardiac remodeling and dysfunction are independent risk factors for CVD. Recent studies have demonstrated that cardiac structure and function are genetically influenced, suggesting that understanding the genetic basis for cardiac structure and function could provide new insights into developing novel therapeutic targets for CVD. Regular exercise has long been considered a robust non-therapeutic method of treating or preventing CVD. However, recent studies also indicate that there is inter-individual variation in response to exercise. Nevertheless, the genetic basis for cardiac structure and function as well as their responses to exercise training have yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, this review summarizes accumulated evidence supporting the genetic contribution to these traits, including findings from population-based studies and unbiased large genomic-scale studies in humans.

A cost function penalizing the state tracking error is used for the MPC design, and the optimal weights of the cost function are systematically obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based optimization problem. The variation in grid impedance is taken into account in the LMI optimization. The stability analysis of the overall system is presented, and the frequency responses of the closed-loop and open-loop system are presented to verify suppression of the filter resonance frequency component. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed controller are validated through frequency response analysis and comparative simulation results.

A control allocation method is adopted to distribute control yaw moment into tire forces, generated by 4WIS. If corrective steering angles of 4WIS are added to front steering angles generated by a driver, it can deteriorate control performance because the lateral tire force of front wheels easily saturated and it causes loss of required yaw moment needed to stabilize a vehicle. To cope with the problem, it is necessary to impose constraints on front slip angles. To compensate the loss of control yaw moment caused by the constraint on front slip angles, a constrained control allocation method is presented.

The locomotor activities of zebrafish embryos were investigated upon exposure to six phthalates: dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP). Moreover, changes in fluorescence intensity in the green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic (Tg) lines Tg(HuC:eGFP), Tg(sox10:eGFP), and Tg(mbp:GFP) were measured after exposure to six phthalates, and changes in the expression profiles of genes involved in the cholinergic (ache) and dopaminergic systems (dat, th, and drd1b) were assessed. Exposure to BBzP, DEHP, and DiNP affected larval behaviors, whereas exposure to DMP, DEP, and DnOP revealed no alterations. A reduced expression of Tg(HuC:eGFP) was observed upon exposure to BBzP, DEHP, and DiNP. The expression of Tg(sox10:eGFP) and Tg(mbp:GFP) was reduced only in response to BBzP and DiNP, respectively. Further, exposure to DiNP upregulated ache and drd1b. The upregulation of ache and downregulation of drd1b was observed in DEHP-exposed groups. Exposure to BBzP suppressed th expression. These observations indicate that exposure to phthalates impaired embryogenesis of the neurological system and neurochemicals in zebrafish embryos, although the detailed mechanisms varied among the individual phthalates. Further mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the causality between phthalate exposure and neurotoxicity. © 2021 by the authors.

These gravitating topological solitons at a large distance from the axis look like a (boosted) cosmic string with an angular defect given by the parameters of the theory, and near the axis, the parameters of the solutions can be chosen so that the metric is singularity free and without angular defect. The curvature is concentrated on a tube around the axis. These solutions are similar to the Cohen–Kaplan global string but regular everywhere, and the non-linear σ-model regularizes the gravitating global string in a similar way as a non-Abelian field regularizes the Dirac monopole. Also, these solutions can be promoted to those of the fully coupled Einstein–Maxwell non-linear σ-model in which the non-linear σ -model is minimally coupled both to the U(1) gauge field and to General Relativity. The analysis shows that these solutions behave as superconductors as they carry a persistent current even when the U(1) field vanishes.

Clinical data support a sexual dimorphism in the time course of aging-associated CVD. However, the mechanisms driving sex differences in cardiovascular aging and whether they can be modeled in mice have not been explored. Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) regulate blood pressure, and we previously demonstrated in male mice that MR expression increases in aging mouse vessels and smooth muscle cell-specific MR deletion (SMC-MR-KO) protects from cardiovascular aging. This study characterizes sex differences in murine cardiovascular aging and the associated sex-specific role of SMC-MR. Aortic stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity, increased from 3 to 12 mo of age in males but not until 18 mo in females. The timing of the rise in aortic stiffening correlated with the timing of increased aortic MR expression, and aortic stiffness did not increase with age in SMC-MR-KO mice of both sexes. Vascular fibrosis increased at 12 mo in males and later at 18 mo in females; however, fibrosis was attenuated by SMC-MR-KO in males only. In resistance vessels, angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R)-mediated vasoconstriction also increased at 12 mo in males and 18 mo in females. ANG II-induced vasoconstriction was decreased in SMC-MR-KO specifically in males in association with decreased AT1R expression. Cardiac systolic function declined in males and females by 18 mo of age, which was prevented by SMC-MR-KO specifically in females. Cardiac perivascular fibrosis increased with age in both sexes accompanied by sex-specific changes in the expression levels of MR-regulated profibrotic genes.

The contact pressure, defined as the pressure applied by the newly deposited layer onto the previous layer, is experimentally calculated as the difference between the pressure during printing and open discharge at the same volumetric flow rates. An analytical method for estimating the contact pressure, assuming one-dimensional steady isothermal flow, is derived for the Newtonian, power-law, and Cross model dependence of shear rates. A design of experiments was performed to characterize the contact pressure as a function of the road width, road height, and print speed. Statistical analysis of the results suggests that the contribution of the pressure driven flow is about twice that of the drag flow in determining contact pressure, which together describe about 60% of the variation in the observed contact pressure behavior. Modeling of the elastic and normal stresses at the nozzle orifice explains an additional 30% of the observed behavior, indicating that careful rheological modeling is required to successfully predict contact pressure. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Design of experiments; Fabrication; Nozzles; Roads and streets; Shear flow; Analytical method; Contact pressures; Fabrication process; High impact polystyrene; Non-Newtonian models; Pressure-driven flows; Rheological modeling; Volumetric flow rate; Non Newtonian flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099385522

A virtual line segment consisting of two corner points detected in a data set is used by the matching algorithm in this study to compute the transformation including the translation and the orientation between two measurement data sets. Because the length of a line segment in a data set is preserved by the transformation, finding a corresponding line segment with similar length in the other measurement data set is easy.

The most significant reason behind using liquid salt water for transparent antenna applications is its excellent average optical transparency (OTav) (>95% at salinity of 40 ppt) compared with other typical solid transparent thin-film electrodes such as indium tin oxide (>73%) or multilayer films (>78%). Each conductive arm of the proposed dipole is constructed from a salt-water layer held between two clear planar acrylic layers ( \varepsilon _{r} = 2.61 , tan \delta = 0.01 , OTav > 90%) (acrylic/salt water/acrylic; ASA) due to surface tension. To investigate the electrical and optical properties of the ASA structure, we analyze the surface tension to determine the thickness of the salt-water layer that finalizes its sheet resistance and OTav. The average gain and efficiency of the antenna are 1.72 dBi and 74%, respectively, in the operating UHF band. This makes the proposed antenna a good candidate for application as a transparent external antenna in UHD TVs and proves that it is possible to use salt water for high-frequency devices. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Dipole antenna; planar antenna; salt water; surface tension; transparent antenna","Digital television; Dipole antennas; Film preparation; High definition television; Liquids; Multilayer films; Optical multilayers; Optical properties; Oxide films; Surface tension; Tin oxides; Transparent electrodes; Antenna applications; Electrical and optical properties; Feasibility studies; High frequency devices; Optical transparency; Transparent thin film; Ultra high definitions; Ultra-high frequency bands; Television antennas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099084265

First, we simulated the sectorial scan technique, frequently employed for the inspection of actual welds, while taking into account the ultrasonic wave mode, frequency, and shape and position of a flaw. Subsequently, we analyzed the flaw sensitivity by comparing A-scan signals and S-scan results. The sensitivity analysis results confirmed the detection of all flaws by considering at least two inspection methods based on the shape and position of the flaw. Furthermore, we verified our model by performing an experiment under the same conditions as the simulation and found that the results were in agreement.

Quantitative analysis with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy exhibited that Ga3+ was first incorporated into LDH through partial dissolution-precipitation at the edge of LDH particle and homogeneously distributed throughout the particle by substitution of Ga3+ for Al3+ in LDH frame works. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the Ga3+ incorporation did not affect the crystal structure without evolution of unexpected impurities. The morphology and surface property of LDH evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and light scattering showed the preservation of physicochemical properties throughout 24 h of hydrothermal reaction. The distribution of incorporated Ga3+ was visualized with energy dispersive spectroscopy-assisted transmission electron microscopy, suggesting the homogeneous location of Ga3+ in an LDH particle. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure suggested that the Ga moiety was immobilized in LDH from 0.5 h and readily crystallized upon reaction time. © 2020 by the authors.

By using two typical current control schemes which are the direct current controller with the capacitor current‐based active damping and integralresonant state feedback current controller, the closed‐loop system stability and current control performance are investigated in the presence of both uncertain grid impedance and distorted grid. Even though the controller stability has been investigated under weak grid in several studies, the stability assessment of the entire current control scheme, including the harmonic resonant controllers, still needs a further comprehensive investigation. The system stability is analyzed by obtaining the movement of the closed‐loop poles in the discrete‐time domain when the grid impedance varies. To fully study the impact of distorted weak grid condition on the LCL filters, three LCL filter parameter sets giving the resonance frequency in different frequency bands are chosen for the purpose of evaluating the system robustness and grid‐injected current quality. In order to support the presented theoretical analyses, comprehensive simulation and experimental results based on 32‐bit DSP TMS320F28335 to control 2 kVA grid‐connected inverter are presented in terms of grid current quality and control stability in the environment of both uncertain grid impedance and distorted grid. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of this work is to remove arsenic (V) (As(V)) from water by using an adsorbent material prepared from mine waste, called MIRESORB™, which contains Fe, Al. The performance of the MIRESORB™ adsorbent was compared with granular ferric hydroxide (GFH), which is a commercial adsorbent. Adsorbents were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and N2 sorption with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. The kinetics, isotherms, and pH-dependency of arsenic adsorption were interrogated to gain insights into arsenic adsorption processes. The maximum adsorption capacity of MIRESORB™ was 50.38 mg/g, which was higher than that of GFH (29.07 mg/g). Moreover, a continuous column test that used environmental samples of acid mine drainage was conducted to evaluate the MIRESORB™ material for practical applications. The column could be operated for more than 5840 bed volumes without a breakthrough. Successful operation of a pilot plant using MIRESORB™ adsorbent was also reported. Thus, these studies demonstrate MIRESORB™ as a highly efficient and economical adsorbent derived from recycled mine sludge waste. © 2020 by the authors.

Walking robots basically require the position control of the leg to accurately land the swing foot on the correct position. Also, they need a force-based balance control to prevent them from falling over on irregular terrain. This study derives the location of the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) to control the Capture Point (CP) for keeping balance of the robot, and additionally obtains the total vertical force required for both feet to maintain the desired height of the Center of Mass (CoM). The vertical force, roll and pitch moments of each foot that optimally satisfies the derived ZMP and the total vertical force of the both feet, are calculated through the Quadratic Programming (QP). To realize the vertical force, roll and pitch moments of each foot, a feedforward control using Jacobian and a PI control using a force/torque sensor at the foot are used simultaneously, and the horizontal forces and yaw moment of each foot are used in Task-Space PD control for positioning of foot. Finally, the proposed method is verified through balance control experiments in double support and single support phases using the biped walking robot, SUBO-1 in the presence of external force and varying ground slope. © 2020, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Balance control; Biped walking robot; Force-position hybrid control","Feedforward control; Flight dynamics; Gait analysis; Mobile robots; Quadratic programming; Balance control; Biped walking robots; Force/torque sensor; Horizontal forces; Hybrid controls; Irregular terrain; Vertical force; Zero moment point; Position control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097014004

The toxic nature of the obtained ZnO NRs was analyzed using the Daniorerio model, and the results showed that it was nontoxic. The anticancer activity of ZnO NRs was also analyzed using a human lung cancer cell line (A549), and excellent results were observed about the cancer cell death pathway. Hence, it was confirmed that the acquired ZnO NRs were nontoxic and had magnificent antibacterial and antioxidant activities. They can be used as an anticancer drug for health-care implementations. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",,"Antioxidants; Cell culture; Cell death; Diseases; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Nanorods; Oxide minerals; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Photocatalytic activity; Plants (botany); Scanning electron microscopy; Spectrometers; Anti-oxidant activities; Anticancer activities; Anticancer drug; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectrometer; Human lung cancer cell line; Photo-catalytic; Transmission electron; Zinc oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096504901

For the proposed tool design, a homography-based camera-projector calibration method was applied with the use of red-green-blue-depth images from a Kinect V2 sensor that did not require accurate camera calibration prerequisites. In addition, the proposed tool simultaneously achieved static projection mapping that projected the image content onto a fixed object, and dynamic projection mapping that projected the image content onto a user's body, by tracing the moving user. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed content-creation tool, users with no programming capabilities were employed to create contents that were projected onto various objects in fixed positions and a user's body in various poses, thereby analyzing the tool's completeness.

These applications need tailored information with respect to a BIM model element's attributes and relationships. In particular, architectural elements need further qualification concerning their geometric and functional ‘subtypes’ to support exact simulations and compliance checks. BIM and its underlying data schema, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), provide a rich representation with which to exchange semantic entity and relationship data. However, subtypes for individual elements are not represented by default and often require manual designation, leaving it vulnerable to errors and omissions. Existing research to enrich the semantics of IFC model entities employed domain-specific rule sets that scrutinize their legitimacy and modify them, if and when necessary. However, such an approach is limited in their scalability and comprehensibility. This study explored the use of 3D geometric deep neural networks originating from computer vision research. Specifically, Multi-view CNN(MVCNN) and PointNet were investigated to determine their applicability in extracting unique features of door (IfcDoor) and wall (IfcWall) element subtypes, and in turn be leveraged to automate subtype classifications. Test results indicated MVCNN as having the best prediction performance, while PointNet's accuracy was hampered by resolution loss due to selective use of point cloud data. The research confirmed deep neural networks as a viable solution to distinguishing BIM element subtypes, the critical factor being their ability to detect subtle differences in local geometries. © 2020","Building information modeling; Deep learning; Industry foundation classes; Machine learning; Semantic integrity","Architectural design; Compliance control; Deep neural networks; Geometry; Semantics; Walls (structural partitions); Architectural element; Automatic classification; Building Information Model - BIM; Compliance checks; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Point cloud data; Prediction performance; Relationship data; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095915865

A step forward, to ensure precise control over the architecture-based distribution and activities of cells, cell-laden 3D bioprinting is in focused research at present for the regeneration of the tissue or organ. The process should ensure maximum viability and minimum stress for the encapsulated cells before, during and after printing. Thus, the printing properties of the bioinks are often compromised, and printing multilayered, large, complex organ with reasonably good resolution becomes a challenging task. Nanocomposite bioinks have caught scientists’ attention considering this aspect. Along with the structural stability and shape fidelity improvement during and after printing, the controlled use of nano-biomaterials induces differentiation, enhances cell growth, proliferation and extracellular matrix factor secretion.

In this study, we proposed a selective reflector (SR) with a dielectric/metal/dielectric structure to increase the power output of BFPVs and ensure a clear view through the BFPV windows. The SRs exhibit a high transmittance in the visible-light region and a high reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR)-light region. By recycling unabsorbed photons by SR, the power output of the SR-incorporated BFPVs is 13.2% higher than that of the BFPVs with bare glass. Moreover, the SR prevents the heating of the interior of buildings by reflecting the NIR light.

With new underground lines being constructed close to existing underground lines the soil deformation around the underground tunnels should be studied and analyzed with proper tunnel model tests. Therefore, we conducted non-target soil deformation mapping using photogrammetry for two different underground tunnel models of sandy soil and clay. Self-calibrated cameras were used to acquire before and after images of the models with the loading test. With accurately estimated exterior orientation parameters (EOPs), the soil deformation was measured via image matchings between two images. Different image matching parameters were tested and the effect of filtering was investigated to produce soil deformation vectors on the images. Experimental results showed that sandy soil and clay required different matching window sizes for the best results. In addition, the deformation vector filtering was helpful to suppress outliers only when an image matching threshold was not applied. With proper matching parameter setup and filtering, the visually informative soil deformation vector map could be generated using photogrammetry. © 2020, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","Geotechnical; Mapping; Non-target; Photogrammetry; Soil deformation; Underground tunnel model","Deformation; Image matching; Mapping; Photogrammetry; Sand; Soils; Traffic congestion; Calibrated cameras; Complex urban environments; Deformation vectors; Exterior orientation parameters; Matching parameters; Matching threshold; Underground lines; Underground tunnels; Tunnels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093850843

Dual-size foam glass media with stone and sand layers were applied and the efficiency of road runoff treatment was investigated according to filtration and micro-flocculation under various experimental conditions (stone/sand layer ratio, linear velocity, and coagulant types). Moreover, the removal efficiencies of suspended solids (SS), phosphorus, organic carbon, and heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd) by CMF were evaluated. The removal rate of SS was maintained to be above 84.1% for 1 h filtration by the dual-size foam glass, regardless of increasing pressure. The removal of phosphorus by micro-flocculation was more suitable in alum than ferric due to a higher initial floc growth rate and an increased particle size. The performance of the CMF was significantly improved over media filtration only process (MF) in removing both particulate and dissolved contaminants. The removal efficiency of all particulate pollutants by CMF was found to be more than 90%, and notably, the dissolved phosphorus, which was mostly not removed by MF, was also removed by 97.4%. Meanwhile, the backwash efficiency of CMF was half that of MF. Physical removal mechanisms, such as internal diffusion, dominated MF, whereas chemical removal mechanisms, such as adsorption and surface precipitation, dominated CMF.

The objective of this article is, therefore, to investigate the public value of accomplishing the plan applying the contingent valuation (CV), a technique that asks randomly chosen people about their willingness to pay (WTP) for the accomplishment. For this purpose, a CV survey of 1000 households was conducted using a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question format for a method of WTP elicitation and yearly household income tax for a payment vehicle. Since a number of interviewees (60.5%) reported zero WTP values, a spike model was adopted to analyze the gathered CV data with zero WTP observations.

This study quantifies this strength of the clustering tendency as a single econometric measure, referred to as modularity. Through an empirical study of the US equity market, we demonstrate that the strength of the clustering tendency changes over time with market fluctuations. That is, normal markets tend to have a clear cluster structure (high modularity), while stressed markets tend to have a blurry cluster structure (low modularity). Modularity assesses the quality of an investment opportunity set in terms of potential diversification benefits. Modularity is an important pricing variable in the cross-sectional returns of US stocks. From 1992 to 2015, the average return of the stocks with the lowest sensitivity to modularity (low modularity beta) exceeds that of the stocks with the highest sensitivity (high modularity beta) by approximately 10.49% annually, adjusted for the Fama-French five-factor exposures. The inclusion of modularity as an asset pricing factor, therefore, expands the investment opportunity set for factor-based investors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Asset pricing model; Basis assets; Cluster analysis; Factor model; Investment opportunity set",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091677234

However, harvesting non-uniformly distributed rear incident light is a very challenge issue in BF-PV. In this study, we empirically investigated the effect of an inhomogeneous rear surface on the power and reliability of a BF-PV. The mini-module test showed that a non-uniform rear reflection triggers a current mismatch among cells, resulting in the overheating of cells above the low reflectance surface. In particular, a large difference in the reflectance inside the rear reflector installed close to the module increases a hot-spot risk. This risk can be reduced by minimizing the variation of the reflectance, as well as elongating the distance between the cell and the reflector. A theoretical calculation based on empirical results indicated that an inhomogeneous rear reflector results in power loss or a reliability issue in BF-PV modules. Hence, the rear surface of a BF-PV module should be carefully designed or considered in order to maximize its performance and reliability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bifacial photovoltaic; Building-integrated photovoltaic; Hotspot; Rear surface reflection","Photovoltaic cells; Reflection; Reliability; Building integrated; Current mismatch; High power output; In-buildings; Incident light; Performance and reliabilities; Photovoltaic modules; Theoretical calculations; Zero energy buildings; building; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; reliability analysis; risk assessment; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090748477

It is very important to comprehend what kind of attributes play a role in adequate safety information flow in a communication network. For these reasons, the current study aimed to explore the effectiveness of safety communication on safety awareness and behavior. The data were collected by performing interviews with employees of teams at a liquefied natural gas terminal located in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. A social network analysis (SNA) was applied to visualize the pattern of the safety communication network and calculate the typical SNA metrics such as density, tie strength, betweenness and degree centrality. In addition, the number of communication channels was also considered as a crucial differentiator between teams. Then, a correlation analysis was applied to investigate the impact of calculated SNA metrics on safety awareness and behavior. As a result, density, tie strength, degree centrality and the channel variety showed a direct influence on safety awareness and behavior. Conversely, betweenness centrality was not an active metric. This study demonstrated that raising the level of SNA metrics such as density, tie strength and degree centrality, and using various channels to communicate safety information within teams, could support better safety awareness and behavior. © 2019 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).","liquefied natural gas terminal; petrochemical; safety awareness; safety behavior; safety communication; social network analysis","natural gas; human; interpersonal communication; South Korea; Communication; Humans; Natural Gas; Republic of Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090313249

The government needs quantitative information on the economic effects of the two sectors. This article aims to derive such information through an input-output (IO) analysis using the recently published 2015 IO table. The production-inducing effects, value-added creation effects, and wage-inducing effects of one dollar of production in the two sectors are analyzed using a demand-driven model. One dollar of production or investment in the two sectors causes 1.606 and 1.718 dollars of production, 0.856 and 0.859 dollars of value-added, and 0.168 and 0.174 dollars of wage, respectively. The economic effects of the RE sector are greater than those of the NP sector. The supply-shortage effects of the two sectors are examined using a supply-driven model. One dollar of supply shortage in the RE and NP sectors brings 1.673 and 1.670 dollars of production failure, respectively. The production failure resulting from the supply shortage in the RE sector is smaller than that of the NP sector. A price-side model also revealed that a 10% increase in the price of output in the NP and RE sectors raises the overall price levels by 0.05858% and 0.01304%, respectively. The RE sector is thus better than the NP sector in terms of minimizing supply shortage effects and price-pervasive effects, as well as maximizing economic effects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic effect; Input-output analysis; Nuclear power; Renewable energy","Investments; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Outages; Wages; Demand-driven; Energy transitions; Korean Government; Production failure; Quantitative information; Renewable energies; Renewable energy deployments; Supply shortages; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089670364

In the proposed scheme, an additional proportional control loop based on the system frequency deviation operating in conjunction with maximum power point tracking operation is used. In the OFS, to improve the energy-storing capability, the scheme suggests the gain of the frequency deviation control loop, which is set to be monotonously decreasing with the rotor speed while being significantly larger than that in the UFS. In the UFS, to improve the energy-releasing capability while preventing over-deceleration, the gain of the frequency deviation control loop is set to be a linear function of the rotor speed. The simulation results under continuously varying wind speeds with different wind patterns and wind speeds clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly mitigates the output power fluctuations of a VSWTG. The proposed scheme keeps the frequency within a narrow range, thereby reducing the required primary frequency control reserve for regulating the frequency under normal operations. © 2021, ICROS, KIEE and Springer.","Control gain; energy-releasing capability; energy-storing capability; over-frequency section; power smoothing; under-frequency section; variable-speed wind turbine generator","Maximum power point trackers; Turbogenerators; Wind; Wind turbines; Control gains; Energy releasing; energy-storing capability; over-frequency section; Power smoothing; Under frequencies; Variable speed wind turbines; Speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077361356

Additionally, the performance of a device should be verified before on-site installation. In this context, an upflow filtration system using novel high porosity floating fibrous media formed into spherical shape was proposed and evaluated for solid capture and backwashing. At filtration velocities of 20–40 m/h, the maximum head loss was about 2 cm even under a solid load of 30 kg/m2, and suspended solid (SS) removal efficiency was &gt;96% throughout 300 min. A considerable amount of SS was removed in the pretreatment chamber, so the load on the media was reduced. Several models were tried to describe the solid capture in the media. The coefficients of solid attachment/detachment showed good correlations with filtration velocity. Other parameters indicated a variation of solid capture and permeability, which is unique to the media in this study. The backwashing with air and water for 1–2 min each showed good head loss recovery under the SS load up to 550–600 kg/m2, and the SS discharge was more efficient when the stagnant water was drained before water backwashing.

Seokgatap pagoda is chosen as a representative Korean stone pagoda in Silla dynasty for the study. The numerical modeling of it is constructed with the same specification and conditions of the real structure and dynamic centrifuge test. In the analysis, the ground motion record from the Ofunato earthquake is input to the modeling, with various peak acceleration levels from 0.06 g to 0.45 g, and results are obtained at different heights of the pagoda structure from 0.2 m to 5.44 m. The analytical results of mode shapes, time domain signal, frequency response, peak ground acceleration, as well as amplification ratio, are estimated to assess seismic behavior, and these are verified with the results of the dynamic centrifuge test. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Dynamic centrifuge test; peak acceleration; seismic performance; simulation analysis; stone pagoda","Centrifuges; Earthquakes; Frequency response; Masonry materials; Seismic waves; Software testing; Towers; Centrifuge tests; Peak acceleration; Seismic Performance; Simulation analysis; stone pagoda; Time domain analysis; assessment method; centrifugal model test; dynamic response; finite element method; ground motion; historical record; masonry; peak acceleration; seismic response; simulation; software; Comunidad Valencia; Silla; Spain; Valencia [Comunidad Valencia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073940945
